Almost all of that work is done in the open; if you want to know what I or the rest of the core development team is thinking about or working on you could watch [the github repository](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/) for code changes, subscribe to [the bitcoin-development mailing list](http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/mailarchive\/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development), and\/or watch the discussions we\u2019re having in the #bitcoin-dev IRC chat channel (which is [archived on the web](http:\/\/bitcoinstats.com\/irc\/bitcoin-dev\/logs\/)).\n\nAs Inigo Montoya [said](http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/character\/ch0003786\/quotes), \u201cNo, there is too much.\u201d So once a month or so I plan on posting a summary here to let you know what we\u2019ve been doing and thinking about.\n\n\n#  Scaling Up\n\nTransaction volume on the Bitcoin network is way up, and although that is a challenge it is a good problem to have. If you are running the reference implementation (bitcoind or Bitcoin-Qt) then you have probably noticed that the blockchain contains 3 gigabytes of transactions, and is growing by a few gigabytes a year.\n\nDownloading a few gigabytes of data before you can start using Bitcoin is not a good first user experience. Disk space is cheap, but time is valuable, and nobody likes to wait.\n\nPart of the solution is to encourage alternative implementations that make different trust\/convenience tradeoffs than the reference implementation. There has been a lot of behind-the-scenes work on cross-implementation testing (the \u201ctestnet3\u2033 blockchain contains hundreds of transaction validation test cases, for example), and new features are being added to the protocol to support alternative implementations\u2013 next major release of bitcoind\/Bitcoin-Qt (version 0.8) should support for \u201cbloom filters\u201d to get just the transactions relevant to your wallet, for example (the bloom filter work has been a real team effort, with Matt Corallo, Mike Hearn, Jeff Garzik and Pieter Wuille all helping with the design, prototyping, coding or optimizing).\n\nAnother part of the solution is to improve the reference implementation. We have a clear idea of what needs to be done, and have started doing it\u2013 we just need to be *extremely* careful as we make changes, and think about things like network-wide effects if we do something like not requiring everybody running the reference implementation to store every single transaction since the beginning of the blockchain.\n\nYou will see the first steps in the 0.8 release; Pieter Wuille has been busy reworking the reference implementation to optimize transaction storage so validating transactions requires much less disk access and memory, and laying the groundwork for further optimizations.\n\nAs transaction volume increases, transaction fees become more important. Miners using a current version of the reference implementation to create blocks now select transactions based on fees, so, theoretically, you can now pay a little bit more if you want your transactions to be confirmed quickly (if you are surprised that the reference implementation didn\u2019t always do that, you\u2019re not alone). Making transaction fees less mysterious for end-users is high on my development priority list.\n\n\n# Wallet\/Payment Security\n\nThe good news is all of the core infrastructure for very-secure online wallets and payments is in place. The network will accept \u201cmultisignature\u201d transactions and there have been no bugs or issues with the low-level functionality.\n\nThe bad news is there is still a lot of higher-level design and implementation that needs to be worked out to make it easy for ordinary people to use. I have been spending a lot of time thinking about multi-device wallets, two- and three-party escrow transactions, new payment protocols and store-and-forward messaging, and expect to be writing some prototype code and recruiting people to help figure out how to bring convenient, ultra-secure wallets and transactions to everybody.\n\n\n# And the rest\u2026\n\nThere is always too much to do, and not enough time to do it! Thorough testing is still the core development team\u2019s biggest challenge; it is a lot more fun to write new code than it is to write unit tests or fix bugs. Gregory Maxwell and Matt Corallo have been doing great work on automated testing tools.\n\nIdentifying and fixing potential security problems before they become disasters is always the highest priority, and coordinating changes to make life more difficult for potential attackers (like tightening up the rules for encoding transaction signatures) is another big, ongoing challenge.\n\nLately I\u2019ve been busy helping to launch this Foundation, and I expect to be spending part of my time over the next few months thinking about and [discussing](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/forum\/ \"Foundation Forums\") how the Foundation can be a catalyst for Bitcoin development.\n\nIt is a great time to be a Bitcoin developer; there are so many interesting, hard, potentially world-changing problems to work on the biggest challenge is deciding what to do first!\n\n\n","html":"<p>I spend most of my time &#8220;down in the code&#8221; &#8212; reviewing proposed code changes, thinking about high-priority problems that nobody else seems to be tackling, and, when I&#8217;m lucky, actually tackling some of those high-priority problems by writing code.

In other words, it is both the train track and the train which is what gives bitcoin the ability to function smoothly without third-party intermediaries.\n\nWhy is this significant? Without intermediaries, bitcoin is not subject to being appropriated or usurped by governments for their political agendas in the way that monarchs assumed the privileges of minting and stamping the gold coins of the realm, which were eventually \u2018clipped\u2019 and later morphed into lower grade metals. Historically, civilized society has not seen an opportunity like this before nor what kind of economic revolution can be sparked by a sustainable, independent monetary unit.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation is an educational and software research organization offering annual memberships and a standard donation program. The donation program can be anonymous and is open to any group or any individual and the funding is put to work in the same way as membership funding. Corporations from a broad range of industries, NGOs, and other nonprofit organizations are likely benefactors to the Bitcoin Foundation. Through a collaborative alliance, we can extend your organization\u2019s reach and enhance your stated mission. Below I outline some of the significant initiative areas where we are already having a measurable impact:\n\n*Human Rights and Social Justice*\n\nCitizens from many countries are blocked out of the typical payment channels like PayPal and credit cards simply because they lack access to a bank account. Sometimes, even those that have banking infrastructures within their countries are blocked out due to poor credit histories or insurmountable fees. Around the globe and including remote parts of Africa and Asia, bitcoin combined with mobile technology is providing a means for previously disenfranchised consumers to enter the worldwide marketplace. With the liberating power of bitcoin, responsible individuals can take control of their own financial lives and operate as both consumer and merchant. Now that is *real* financial empowerment.\n\n*Privacy*\n\nFinancial privacy is a fundamental human right but lately it has become as vulnerable as email privacy or data privacy. You cannot take your privacy for granted \u2014 you have to claim it. As governments and law enforcement increasingly use money channels as a way to track identity, they give up on the original crime that they were investigating and everything becomes a potential monetary crime. No one is immune to getting ensnarled in that type of fishing expedition. The ends do not justify the means. Free speech advocates and political dissidents can be identified and persecuted simply because of a payment that they made to a certain group or company. Bitcoin restores some of that balance back to the individual in that it permits user-defined anonymity and user-defined traceability.\n\n*Sound Public Policy*\n\nPublic policy efforts should aim for freedom of choice in currencies for several economic reasons. Quantitative easing is a sophisticated sounding term made up by the politicians and bureaucrats. It really means inflating the money supply but that phrase sounds too negative and irresponsible. If the sovereign treasuries around the world can endlessly purchase their own debt and inject liquidity into the economy via monetary and fiscal stimulus, then why do they need taxes? Unfortunately, we suffer both taxation and growing inflation. Average working people and the elderly are impacted the most through the inevitable devaluation of the currency. Since Bitcoin is not the liability of anyone else and cannot be devalued, an easy and safe store of value is provided so that someone\u2019s life savings cannot be inflated away by the whims of a political class.\n\n*Math and Science*\n\nAdvanced mathematics and science propels innovation and enhances the standard of living for everyone. Technology and the Internet have already made things possible that we never thought we would observe in our lifetimes. I look forward to more breakthroughs and greater accomplishments. Through its freely-available, open source software bitcoin educates individuals about cryptographic money, public key cryptography, and distributed computing. In just under four years the bitcoin p2p project has become the world\u2019s single largest [distributed computing project](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_distributed_computing_projects).\n\nWe welcome your support in advancing the common goals that we share.

Now that is <em>real<\/em> financial empowerment.<\/p>\n<p><em>Privacy<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Financial privacy is a fundamental human right but lately it has become as vulnerable as email privacy or data privacy. You cannot take your privacy for granted &#8212; you have to claim it. As governments and law enforcement increasingly use money channels as a way to track identity, they give up on the original crime that they were investigating and everything becomes a potential monetary crime. No one is immune to getting ensnarled in that type of fishing expedition. The ends do not justify the means. Free speech advocates and political dissidents can be identified and persecuted simply because of a payment that they made to a certain group or company. Bitcoin restores some of that balance back to the individual in that it permits user-defined anonymity and user-defined traceability.<\/p>\n<p><em>Sound Public Policy<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Public policy efforts should aim for freedom of choice in currencies for several economic reasons. Quantitative easing is a sophisticated sounding term made up by the politicians and bureaucrats. It really means inflating the money supply but that phrase sounds too negative and irresponsible. If the sovereign treasuries around the world can endlessly purchase their own debt and inject liquidity into the economy via monetary and fiscal stimulus, then why do they need taxes? Unfortunately, we suffer both taxation and growing inflation. Average working people and the elderly are impacted the most through the inevitable devaluation of the currency. Since Bitcoin is not the liability of anyone else and cannot be devalued, an easy and safe store of value is provided so that someone&#8217;s life savings cannot be inflated away by the whims of a political class.<\/p>\n<p><em>Math and Science<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Advanced mathematics and science propels innovation and enhances the standard of living for everyone. Technology and the Internet have already made things possible that we never thought we would observe in our lifetimes. I look forward to more breakthroughs and greater accomplishments. Through its freely-available, open source software bitcoin educates individuals about cryptographic money, public key cryptography, and distributed computing.

Unfortunately, a currency does not really exist outside of its country meaning that if you ever open a USD bank account in a European bank or Japanese one, any USD available in this account would, in fact, be held in the Untied States and not in your local\/federal or national bank vault.\n\nWhy does this matter so much when it comes to International Bank Transfers?\n\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that you are a European citizen who wants to purchase a product from a merchant in Taiwan. The currency of choice will most likely be USD. As I said earlier, USD does not really exist out of the US, meaning here that your bank owns a bank account with another bank in America to deal with USD, and the same is true for the merchant\u2019s bank that you are sending money to.\n\nThe process is as follows:\n\nYour bank (A) will send two messages, one to the Merchant Bank (B) and one to its bank in the USA (C) that holds its USD. Bank (C), if you are fortunate enough, holds both Bank (A) and Bank (B) USD accounts and \u201cinstantly\u201d transfer your money, minus a fee, from Bank (A) to Bank (B) locally.\n\nOnce completed, Bank (C) informs Bank (B) that it has received money and Bank (A) that the job has been done. This rather simple flux of cash could become more complicated if Bank (C) only has Bank (A) for a customer and Bank (B) banks with another institution, Bank (D), for its US accounts.\n\nThis very complicated process is, for Bank (C), usually totally autonomous and instant. Still Bank (C), in order to transfer money from one account to another account, will charge you a fee, anywhere from $25 up to $100.\n\nFrom this example you can see that sending international wires is one of the most complicated and inefficient methods to transfer money, not to mention costly. It could easily be replaced by something more efficient and elegant like\u2026 bitcoin!\n\nBitcoin is by far today\u2019s most efficient way to send money from point A to point B without having a third party (Bank (C) in our example) be involved in this exchange. If you want to make a purchase from an overseas merchant, all you need is their bitcoin address. Your payment is instantly sent directly to them over the secure network.\n\nFurthermore, by using the traditional bank wire method, you take the risk of third party government monitoring and interference without your knowledge or express consent. If, in the example above, you make an international transaction from Europe to Taiwan in USD, the US government can interfere with and monitor these transactions by blocking them, following them, and gathering info even if the people involved in the international transaction never step foot on US soil. With bitcoin, that is not the case.\n\nIn an age of rapid technological advancement, booming international commerce and related privacy concerns, bitcoin is an efficient, private alternative solution to traditional banking methods. By continuing to build Mt.Gox and supporting the Bitcoin Foundation, I hope to see bitcoin become the payment system of the future.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Working for the largest Bitcoin exchange with customers around the world gives us an insight that few, other than banks, may have on how international wire transfers work.<\/p>\n<p>The first misconception that many of us may have, myself included when I first came to work for Mt.Gox, was that everyone could create a bank account in whatever currency he\/she wanted in the country of their choosing and have control over it.

We have no spectacular new world-changing features to announce, but that should be expected\u2013 in my experience, the best way to be successful is to try to make steady progress towards your goals every day. But expect that reaching your goals almost always takes longer than you expect, because you always run into unexpected setbacks and detours.\n\nIt was a pretty good month for making steady progress on the reference code; the only setback was a little time taken to roll out a 0.7.2 minor bug-fix release (release notes and binary downloads at [SourceForge](http:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/bitcoin\/files\/Bitcoin\/bitcoin-0.7.2\/ \"0.7.2 release\")).\n\nThe core team received a grant of 470 BTC from the Foundation for infrastructure needs over the next year, which we promptly started to spend. The first purchase is a year\u2019s rental of a fairly powerful (six-core, 12GB memory) dedicated server that we\u2019ll run several virtual machines on. Matt Corallo has already moved the \u201cjenkins pull tester\u201d to the new machine, and we\u2019re enjoying a much faster turnaround time from when pull requests are submitted or updated until sanity-tested build results (for both Windows and Linux) are available. We\u2019ll be spending the rest of that grant on other infrastructure needs over the coming year; code-signing certificates for Windows and Mac are next on the spending priority list.\n\nTesting and development of the next major release (0.8) continues, with testing being the bottleneck. As I\u2019ve said before, writing code is a lot more fun than testing or reviewing it, but, especially for a project like Bitcoin where serious value is at stake, thorough testing and review is incredibly important. See the [thread in the bitcointalk forums](https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=129861) for how you can help.\n\nA lot of my time in the last month has been working on getting feedback on, and consensus for, a [new payment protocol](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/4120476 \"Bitcoin Payment Messages proposal\"). After lots of great discussion on the bitcoin-development mailing list resulting in over a dozen (so far) revisions to the proposal, I feel like it is solid enough to start creating a prototype implementation ([code on github](https:\/\/github.com\/gavinandresen\/paymentrequest); patches that help tackle items on the [TODO list](https:\/\/github.com\/gavinandresen\/paymentrequest\/blob\/master\/TODO.txt) very welcome!). Mike Hearn deserves a lot of credit\u2013 he did the initial prototyping and has been incredibly helpful contributing great ideas from the very beginning when this was only a half-baked idea, and continuing on through all the public discussions.\n\nCoincidentally, Ilja Gerhardt and Timo Hanke just published a paper that is directly relevant: \u201c[Homomorphic Payment Addresses and the Pay-to-Contract Protocol](http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1212.3257).\u201d I expect a future version of the protocol to be extended to support their ideas\u2013 the first version is designed to make that easy.\n\nSo\u2026 why is a new payment protocol important? A few reasons:\n\nFirst, for security. Today the bitcoin payment protocol looks like this:  \n 1. You get a bitcoin address from someone, via a website, email, QR code, etc.  \n 2. You send bitcoins to that address.\n\nThat works, but is vulnerable to \u201cman in the middle\u201d attacks if the \u201cget a bitcoin address\u201d step is done over some insecure communication channel (like an insecure web page). If somebody can intercept the bitcoin address and replace it with one of their own, they might be able to trick you into sending them coins instead of the person you intend to pay.\n\nI\u2019ve never heard of that actually happening, but as bitcoin payments get more common it is only a matter of time before attackers decide it is worth the effort to try to replace bitcoin addresses that might be going through insecure web or email servers.\n\nThe new payment protocol makes life much harder for potential attackers, by working like this:  \n 1. You get a \u201csigned payment request\u201d from someone, via a website, email, QR code, etc.  \n 2. Your bitcoin software checks the signature to make sure it hasn\u2019t been tampered with by an attacker.  \n 3. You send bitcoins to the address specified in the payment request.\n\nThe second reason for a new payment protocol is also security. Creating much more secure wallets that remain secure even if your computer or mobile phone (or web server, if you are a merchant) is completely compromised by malware is still near the top of my development priority list. The payment protocol is a key part of that\u2013 signed payment requests will be used to make sure bitcoins are only sent to where they are supposed to go, after being properly authorized on more than one device.\n\nThe last reason for a new payment protocol is to make paying with bitcoin less geeky. Bitcoin addresses are **not** user-friendly, and neither is the experience of sending a transaction and getting no immediate feedback that you sent the right amount to the right address. The new payment protocol adds a human-readable, cryptographically-verified identity (so you are asked to approve an 11 BTC payment to \u201cbitcoinfoundation.org\u201d instead of \u201c[1BTCorgHwCg6u2YSAWKgS17qUad6kHmtQW](bitcoin:1BTCorgHwCg6u2YSAWKgS17qUad6kHmtQW?label=Bitcoin+Foundation+Donation)\u201c). It also optionally lets the recipient give the sender a message confirming that their payment was received.\n\nThere are a couple of other spiffy new features, like refund addresses, so merchants can easily refund overpayments or send bitcoins back to customers if their factory is invaded by zombies and they are unable to satisfy orders; see [the proposal](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/4120476) for all the details. It will take at least several months of steady progress before bitcoin wallets and merchants support the new payment protocol.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Since my last status update the core development team has continued to make steady progress.

As we\u2019re embarking on 2013, I wanted to spend a little time reviewing what we\u2019ve done since September, and then laying out some plans \/ predictions for 2013.\n\n**Accomplished Goals**  \n One of the main ways the Foundation can help Bitcoin in 2013 is resource centralization and disbursement; we\u2019ve done some of that so far, and we\u2019re working on more.\n\n- We\u2019ve hired Gavin as Chief Scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation; he\u2019s being paid a regular salary at this point, and is working full time on Bitcoin client and protocol enhancements. This is a major step forward for solidifying the future of the Bitcoin network.\n- We\u2019ve made our first technology grant \u2014 to the core development team \u2014 for build and test servers, windows signing certificates, and a few small sundries.\n- We\u2019ve opened up a [grant proposal process ](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/?p=58) to anyone who wishes to apply for a grant that could further Bitcoin in some way. The deadline is February 15, 2013 \u2014 please put in a proposal!\n- Announced our first conference, [Bitcoin 2013: The Future of Payments](http:\/\/www.bitcoin2013.com\/), for May 17-19 in San Jose.\n- We had a first meeting with the United States\u2019 Government Accountability Office to talk to them about how Bitcoin works. Our brief, productive meeting was a high-level conversation about how Bitcoin fits into the emerging virtual currency space.\n\n**Member Review**  \n We continue to get more and more members signed up \u2014 over 240 at last count. I really appreciate everything you\u2019re doing for the Foundation, and Bitcoin in general. We\u2019re still working out how to best help our members, and I hope we\u2019ll get more knowledgeable about what you all want and need from us this year. We are off to a good start, though, I think.\n\n- We put in place real name forums for members only (if you\u2019re a bitcointalk member and wonder what it\u2019s like, it\u2019s polite and low traffic, plus you can spend time trying to figure out the real names of famous bitcointalk\u2019ers). We\u2019re learning to use this to discuss Foundation plans and procedures; I anticipate use of this will grow organically in 2013.\n- We are going to put up a members page on the site shortly. It\u2019s long overdue. Apologies.\n- We\u2019ve incorporated feedback about the corporate membership prices and benefits, and will be rolling out some improvements soon.\n\n**Going Without a Bank Account**  \n We spent 2012 without a bank account; it was a fun experiment! We can\u2019t do without one in 2013, unfortunately. Payroll taxes have to be paid, and some of our deposits for the conference are too large to do with our current systems. We did work out some basic protocols for accounting and expense reimbursements in Bitcoin, and we\u2019re putting together a white paper as a set of basic process recommendations.\n\nAlso, we continue to denominate our employee salaries in Bitcoins; we\u2019re currently re-pegging them quarterly. They\u2019re generally happy with the arrangement so far.\n\n**Transparency Opportunities**  \n Many of our members have asked for more foundation financial transparency. I\u2019m all for it, in fact I championed publishing all of our public addresses with the Board at launch. The Board voted against it, and in process changed my mind; they noted that there are significant privacy issues publishing these addresses; we will be leaking information about our members by allowing people to backtrack payments to the Foundation. I\u2019d like us to chat about this in the forums and decide what we want to do about it; I fundamentally believe this is a member decision to make, so sound off [here](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/forum\/index.php?\/topic\/38-should-the-foundation-publish-its-btc-addresses\/) if you have thoughts on this.\n\nI anticipate we\u2019ll file a US form 990 which will provide a bunch of standard financial information that the US government requires from non-profits; if so, that will be easy to access for anyone on the Internet.\n\n**Predictions**\n\n*****Significant Investor Interest  \n*I am fielding more phone calls from investors in the last quarter; Bitcoin as an emerging marketplace seems likely to be getting significantly more attention in 2013 from Venture Capitalists. 2012 was the year of Bitcoin Angels, 2013 seems more likely to be a Venture year. I am also starting to hear from Hedge Fund managers; Bitcoin is too small for many of them to invest in, but some more macro-econ oriented managers are keeping an eye on it as \u2018interesting.\u2019 In my judgment, they\u2019re thinking about Bitcoin about how VCs were two years ago. From my view right now, I think 2013 is a year in which investor demand is going to significantly outstrip available Bitcoin deal-flow. If you\u2019ve got a Bitcoin startup idea, work on that product demo and pitch \u2014 this could be your year! (We\u2019re working to get a shark-tank style demo day for the Bitcoin 2013 conference, look for more info on the blog).\n\n*Supply Constraints*  \n I think we\u2019ll start seeing major effects of our first Halving Day by mid 2013; I predict that available Bitcoin supply per block is going to drop as we see ASIC miners come on line \u2014 the most efficient miners on the market will soon be available for the cost of a mid-size sedan, and I do not believe buyers of those machines will flip their Bitcoins. I think they will hold them. This double whammy of 25BTC blocks and (perhaps) a change in miner economics tells me we are likely to see Bitcoin liquidity problems, (or price increases) in 2013.\n\n*More Mainstream Announcements*  \n As larger companies figure out Bitcoin and how they can be involved, I think we\u2019ll start to see significant adoption and exciting announcements.\n\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing you at Bitcoin 2013! As always, get in touch with me at [peter@bitcoinfoundation.org](mailto:peter@bitcoinfoundation.org), or for faster response times, [hello@bitcoinfoundation.org](mailto:hello@bitcoinfoundation.org).\n\n\n","html":"<p>Happy New Year!

The deadline is February 15, 2013 &#8212; please put in a proposal!<\/li>\n<li>Announced our first conference, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bitcoin2013.com\/\">Bitcoin 2013: The Future of Payments<\/a>, for May 17-19 in San Jose.<\/li>\n<li>We had a first meeting with the United States\u2019 Government Accountability Office to talk to them about how Bitcoin works.  Our brief, productive meeting was a high-level conversation about how Bitcoin fits into the emerging virtual currency space.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Member Review<\/strong><br \/>\nWe continue to get more and more members signed up &#8212; over 240 at last count.  I really appreciate everything you\u2019re doing for the Foundation, and Bitcoin in general.  We\u2019re still working out how to best help our members, and I hope we\u2019ll get more knowledgeable about what you all want and need from us this year.  We are off to a good start, though, I think.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>We put in place real name forums for members only (if you\u2019re a bitcointalk member and wonder what it\u2019s like, it\u2019s polite and low traffic, plus you can spend time trying to figure out  the real names of famous bitcointalk\u2019ers).  We\u2019re learning to use this to discuss Foundation plans and procedures; I anticipate use of this will grow organically in 2013.<\/li>\n<li>We are going to put up a members page on the site shortly.  It\u2019s long overdue.  Apologies.<\/li>\n<li>We\u2019ve incorporated feedback about the corporate membership prices and benefits, and will be rolling out some improvements soon.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Going Without a Bank Account<\/strong><br \/>\nWe spent 2012 without a bank account; it was a fun experiment!  We can\u2019t do without one in 2013, unfortunately.  Payroll taxes have to be paid, and some of our deposits for the conference are too large to do with our current systems.  We did work out some basic protocols for accounting and expense reimbursements in Bitcoin, and we\u2019re putting together a white paper as a set of basic process recommendations.<\/p>\n<p>Also, we continue to denominate our employee salaries in Bitcoins; we\u2019re currently re-pegging them quarterly.  They\u2019re generally happy with the arrangement so far.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transparency Opportunities<\/strong><br \/>\nMany of our members have asked for more foundation financial transparency.  I\u2019m all for it, in fact I championed publishing all of our public addresses with the Board at launch.  The Board voted against it, and in process changed my mind; they noted that there are significant privacy issues publishing these addresses; we will be leaking information about our members by allowing people to backtrack payments to the Foundation.  I\u2019d like us to chat about this in the forums and decide what we want to do about it; I fundamentally believe this is a member decision to make, so sound off <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/forum\/index.php?\/topic\/38-should-the-foundation-publish-its-btc-addresses\/\">here<\/a> if you have thoughts on this.<\/p>\n<p>I anticipate we\u2019ll file a US form 990 which will provide a bunch of standard financial information that the US government requires from non-profits; if so, that will be easy to access for anyone on the Internet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Predictions<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong><\/strong><em>Significant Investor Interest<br \/>\n<\/em>I am fielding more phone calls from investors in the last quarter; Bitcoin as an emerging marketplace seems likely to be getting significantly more attention in 2013 from Venture Capitalists.  2012 was the year of Bitcoin Angels, 2013 seems more likely to be a Venture year.  I am also starting to hear from Hedge Fund managers; Bitcoin is too small for many of them to invest in, but some more macro-econ oriented managers are keeping an eye on it as \u2018interesting.\u2019  In my judgment, they\u2019re thinking about Bitcoin about how VCs were two years ago.  From my view right now, I think 2013 is a year in which investor demand is going to significantly outstrip available Bitcoin deal-flow.  If you\u2019ve got a Bitcoin startup idea, work on that product demo and pitch &#8212; this could be your year!  (We\u2019re working to get a shark-tank style demo day for the Bitcoin 2013 conference, look for more info on the blog).<\/p>\n<p><em>Supply Constraints<\/em><br \/>\nI think we\u2019ll start seeing major effects of our first Halving Day by mid 2013; I predict that available Bitcoin supply per block is going to drop as we see ASIC miners come on line &#8212; the most efficient miners on the market will soon be available for the cost of a mid-size sedan, and I do not believe buyers of those machines will flip their Bitcoins.  I think they will hold them.  This double whammy of 25BTC blocks and (perhaps) a change in miner economics tells me we are likely to see Bitcoin liquidity problems, (or price increases) in 2013.<\/p>\n<p><em>More Mainstream Announcements<\/em><br \/>\nAs larger companies figure out Bitcoin and how they can be involved, I think we\u2019ll start to see significant adoption and exciting announcements.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you at Bitcoin 2013!

And for a year now, the community has been abuzz with rumors and a fierce competition by several companies to be the first to market with the holy grail of hashing.\n\nAnd to be sure, ASICs are not just a marginal improvement in technology \u2013 they represent a mining efficiency upgrade of roughly 50x. Big money, for anyone who can get one up and running and out of the land of unicorns and rainbows.\n\nA winner has finally emerged. Yifu Guo, head of BitSynCom LLC and his soon-to-be infamous Avalon brand, has slaughtered all the unicorns. Yifu arrived in New York City last night, after more than two months in China finishing his masterwork. With him, Avalon\u2019s first ASIC V1. As we poured over it this morning, the thought occurred that it should perhaps be named, \u201cHelicopter Ben.\u201d The difference between this machine and Ben Bernanke, of course, is that this thing prints real money, not the unlimited digital currency known as the US dollar.\n\nAs we plugged the beast in (and it is a beast \u2013 the size of a desktop computer in a thick aluminum exoskeleton), three NMB MAT7 fans roared to life. It actually sounded like a helicopter. Once the software starts running, however, the temp-controlled fans quiet down markedly. It\u2019s worth pointing out that, while large, the Avalon V1 looks beautiful inside and out. Clean lines, well-organized, and sturdy \u2013 it looks professional.\n\nBut how does it perform? Beautifully. The unit in front of us, after 30 seconds configuring it with the laptop, was churning out 89 gigahashes of raw crypto-juice every second. This is equal to roughly 250 Radeon HD 5850 graphics cards. And while each of those graphics cards would suck up 200 watts, the Avalon V1 takes only 500-600 watts in total. This isn\u2019t about slowing carbon emissions, it\u2019s about bringing maximum security to the network at the lowest possible cost.\n\nBuyers of the first batch should know that the Avalon units are modular and upgradeable. The stock V1\u2019s will have 3 hashing modules putting out roughly 67 gigahashes per second in total. This model unit in front of us had been upgraded to 4 sets of chips (one more than stock) which is why it puts out over 80 gigahashes. Buyers of the V2 batch, which goes on sale within a day or two, will have room for six sets of chips (V1\u2019s maxing out at 4).\n\nWhile Helicopter Ben was humming away on the desk, we did some quick calculations. We realized, amazingly, that the machine is actually earning more than minimum wage here in New York City. But unlike a typical employee, this thing works 24\/7, taking no holidays, and demanding no healthcare or special benefits. And it won\u2019t ever unionize.\n\nBut more than just techie hardware advance, there\u2019s a human narrative worth observing. Sitting on the desk, next to the V1, is a 23 year old bottle of Ron Zacapa rum, to commemorate Yifu Guo\u2019s 23rd birthday today. He\u2019s 23, and he just took Bitcoin mining into a new era. We could tell that Yifu was proud of his creation, and he should be.\n\nYifu had begun this process a year ago, as he was worried that if only one or two companies built ASICs, and they built too many of them for themselves, it would represent a threat to the Bitcoin network. What if those companies held all the chips and commanded 51% of the network? It was unlikely, but possible, and so Yifu set out to build ASICs of his own, knowing he could trust himself to get them into the hands of diverse customers. Decentralization, and all that.\n\nWhile he knew he\u2019d never be the first to market, at least he\u2019d be protecting the network. As it turns out, Yifu\u2019s competitors suffered delays, and a couple competitors dropped out of the market completely. Yifu eventually realized that Avalon would be the first brand of ASIC to actually hit the market, \u201cI became the centralization that I set out to destroy,\u201d he jokes.\n\nThose who trusted Yifu with their capital will be richly rewarded, and the Bitcoin network is about to become far more secure. ASIC\u2019s have gone from hypothesis to product. A new piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure has been built.\n\nMany of us see the Bitcoin world as the Wild West, and it\u2019s an apt analogy.

They were diverse in their scope and intention, and we had a good time talking them over at the Foundation. Quite a few of you asked for guidance as to scope, direction, and amount \u2014 all great questions.\n\nWe didn\u2019t say much in response because, honestly, we didn\u2019t know \u2014 we kind of wanted to see how we felt after looking at the first round. So, now we know more, and I wanted to put out some thoughts, partly for guidance to future grant requesters, and partly to rally some conversation about the future of Bitcoin.\n\nSome areas we all felt pretty strongly we wouldn\u2019t give grants for:\n\n- *Viable Business Ideas*  \n We got a number of pretty interesting business ideas thrown at us in grant request form. I think the universal reaction from the board was that the proposers should go ahead and launch those businesses, find investors, and generally get to work doing their idea.

So, I asked that he write them up to share with you all here. All thoughts and opinions, brilliant or otherwise, are his own.*\n\n**FinCEN Guidance Validates Bitcoin Industry but Targets Satoshi  \n By Dan Friedberg **\n\nA week ago, a bureau of the US Treasury Department issued guidance on the application of money transmitter rules, which significantly impacts the Bitcoin industry. Although the guidance imposes obligations on certain industry participants, it is a positive first step towards regulatory acceptance, and, at least so far, the volatile bitcoin trading market has treated it as such.\n\nFinCEN, the Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, issued guidance on March 18, 2013 available at HYPERLINK \u201chttp:\/\/www.fincen.gov\u201d www.fincen.gov that addresses the legal treatment of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin.\n\nFor the uninitiated, FinCEN is a law enforcement bureau with the mission of safeguarding the financial system from illicit use, combating money laundering, and promoting national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and strategic use of financial authorities.\n\nFinCEN clarified that in the eyes of the US Treasury, \u201cvirtual currency\u201d is different from \u201creal currency\u201d. \u201cReal currency\u201d includes the United States dollar or money or other legal tender. \u201cVirtual currency\u201d like Bitcoin is not \u201creal currency\u201d. However, FinCEN indicated that certain \u201cvirtual currency\u201d industry participants are money service businesses subject to registration requirements as well as a range of anti-money laundering and reporting responsibilities.\n\nThe guidance pulled no punches with respect to a \u201ccreator\u201d of a de-centralized virtual currency. The creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, falls squarely within these rules to the extent he is \u201ca person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency\u201d.\n\nIs a \u201cminer\u201d of bitcoin, a person who receives \u201cnew\u201d bitcoin in exchange for his computing efforts, considered a \u201ccreator\u201d under the guidance? A person who obtains bitcoin by his own manufacturing effort is not differentiated from an ordinary \u201cuser\u201d under the guidance, and informal communications from regulatory sources indicate that it is unlikely the guidance intended to consider every \u201cminer\u201d a \u201ccreator\u201d. This is confusing because in the bitcoin community, a successful miner might be thought of as *creating* new coin.\n\nAlso \u201cexchangers\u201d and \u201cadministrators\u201d, including certain persons \u201cengaged as a business\u201d in \u201cvirtual currency\u201d transactions are subject to money transmitter limitations and may be subject to licensure requirements.\n\nOne very positive aspect of the guidance is that it opens the door for the largest licensed money transmitters to accept and deal in bitcoin transactions, albeit subject to significant limitations, including BSA\/AML requirements which would make bitcoin transactions much more transparent, in contrast to the anonymity of the current regime.\n\nThe FinCEN guidance has a significant impact on participants in the bitcoin industry. Market participants should retain qualified counsel to assess their business strategies, risks and compliance programs in light of this guidance.\n\n*About the Author*\n\n*Dan Friedberg of Graham & Dunn PC is a business lawyer specializing in complex transactions and regulatory compliance, including digital currency.

The creator of Bitcoin, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, falls squarely within these rules to the extent he is \u201ca person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Is a \u201cminer\u201d of bitcoin, a person who receives \u201cnew\u201d bitcoin in exchange for his computing efforts, considered a \u201ccreator\u201d under the guidance? A person who obtains bitcoin by his own manufacturing effort is not differentiated from an ordinary \u201cuser\u201d under the guidance, and informal communications from regulatory sources indicate that it is unlikely the guidance intended to consider every \u201cminer\u201d a \u201ccreator\u201d. This is confusing because in the bitcoin community, a successful miner might be thought of as <em>creating<\/em> new coin.<\/p>\n<p>Also \u201cexchangers\u201d and \u201cadministrators\u201d, including certain persons \u201cengaged as a business\u201d in \u201cvirtual currency\u201d transactions are subject to money transmitter limitations and may be subject to licensure requirements.<\/p>\n<p>One very positive aspect of the guidance is that it opens the door for the largest licensed money transmitters to accept and deal in bitcoin transactions, albeit subject to significant limitations, including BSA\/AML requirements which would make bitcoin transactions much more transparent, in contrast to the anonymity of the current regime.<\/p>\n<p>The FinCEN guidance has a significant impact on participants in the bitcoin industry.  Market participants should retain qualified counsel to assess their business strategies, risks and compliance programs in light of this guidance.<\/p>\n<p><em>About the Author<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Dan Friedberg of Graham &amp; Dunn PC is a business lawyer specializing in complex transactions and regulatory compliance, including digital currency.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/surprisinglyfree.com\/2013\/04\/16\/marc-hochstein\/\">smarter commentators<\/a> have paid greater attention to its potential as a means of exchange. But what about the third key role of money, as a unit of account? Bitcoins, after all, are divisible to the eighth decimal place, and this is another disruptive component. <a href=\"http:\/\/evoorhees.blogspot.com\/\">Erik Voorhees<\/a>, a bitcoin early adopter involved in several leading bitcoin-related companies, such as BitInstant, SatoshiDice and Coinapult, will encourage thinking on this as he discusses the economics of Bitcoin and its role as money.<\/p>\n<p>Ever since the bitcoin cryptocurrency launched and achieved initial success, institutional investors and hedge fund managers have secretly sought a regulated investment vehicle for bitcoin placements. Malta-based Exante Ltd. has a solution with its new <a href=\"http:\/\/bitcoinfund.eu\/joinus\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin Fund<\/a>. There remains a case for Bitcoin as a store of value, even after the recent whipsawing. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.zerohedge.com\/news\/2012-11-04\/bitcoin-seen-through-eyes-central-banker\">Tuur Demeester<\/a>, author of the financial newsletter <em>MacroTrends<\/em>, added bitcoin as part of his recommended currency basket in January 2012, and he\u2019ll talk about bitcoin&#8217;s emerging role as a separate asset class alongside precious metals, equities, and bonds.<\/p>\n<p>Last month, my column featured a conversation with software developer and online payments industry veteran <a href=\"http:\/\/dev.economicsofbitcoin.com\/mastersthesis\/mastersthesis-surda-2012-11-19b.pdf\">Peter \u0160urda<\/a> about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanbanker.com\/bankthink\/how-cryptocurrencies-could-upend-banks-monetary-role-1057597-1.html\">how nonpolitical cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could alter the future of fractional reserve banking<\/a>.

As Executive Director, I welcome the new challenge.\n\nThe Foundation has never claimed to represent all of Bitcoin nor all of its users because that would be impossible for any organization. Rather, the Foundation has consistently attempted to fill the gap where market-based incentives may not have produced the same outcome, such as in the areas of specialized grants and compensation transparency for volunteer developers as well as legal challenges to bitcoin usage and the sponsorship of aggressive legal defense.\n\nFor instance, we made our \u201ccease and desist\u201d correspondence with the State of California publicly available which can assist bitcoin exchanges and other bitcoin organizations in the future. Also, we intend to file amicus briefs in significant bitcoin-related legal cases and to offer pro bono legal defense where appropriate.

This will be made publicly available too.\n\nThe Foundation is not pro-regulation as some have claimed, but it is pro-education. I fully support across the board bitcoin education for legislative and regulatory entities. Proper education is not anti-market and I also agree with economist Peter \u0160urda who stated that lobbying on behalf of Bitcoin is not necessarily anti-market. However, constructing barriers to market entry and being complicit in certain crony capitalism regulatory outcomes is anti-market. I will steadfastly oppose a crony capitalism direction for the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nOne of my primary near-term objectives for the Foundation is to become more inclusive of the various constituencies within the global bitcoin community. This will involve being more responsive to and communicative with member requests. It will also involve being more open to internationalization. Currently, 60% of the Foundation\u2019s membership is non-US based and we need to do a better job behaving like a global organization. To this end, we will hold the next Bitcoin conference outside of the United States and we will sign on local Foundation chapters in several countries where interested parties have taken the lead on expanding the principles of Bitcoin in their region.\n\nThe bursting of Bitcoin technology on the scene at this time in history is not a mere coincidence.

The process will be the same for both seats. Individual Members can nominate and vote for the Individual seat, and Industry Members can nominate and vote for the Industry seat.\n\n***How will these new seats impact the current Board of Directors?***\n\nAs outlined in our [bylaws](https:\/\/github.com\/pmlaw\/The-Bitcoin-Foundation-Legal-Repo\/blob\/master\/Bylaws\/Bylaws_of_The_Bitcoin_Foundation.md), the board is currently comprised of one director representing the Founding Members, two directors representing the Industry Members, and two directors for the Individual Members.

The bylaws are the basis for the organizational structure of the Foundation, and all board members must be well versed in their details and impacts on Foundation business.\n- Attend all board meetings. Board members are expected to attend all board meetings. Currently, our regular meetings occur once per month via video conference and are scheduled to accommodate a wide range of time zones of the participants. Interim meetings may also be required from time to time.\n- Occasional travel may be required. Board members may at times be required to travel on behalf of the Foundation. Approved travel costs will be paid by the Foundation.\n- Perform officer roles as assigned. Board members can be assigned officer roles in addition to basic board obligations, and are responsible for all tasks related to those roles as outlined in the bylaws.\n- Act in the best interest of the Foundation and its members. As the public faces of the Foundation, board members should conduct themselves responsibly in addition to actively seeking to further the goals of the Foundation.\n\n***How did you come up with this process?***\n\nThe board convened a special committee of members to help define this process. The committee also solicited feedback on our member forums.

We\u2019ve reviewed and closed over 300 pull requests, which range from correcting the spelling of a word in a comment to major new features like the [payment protocol](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/BIP_0070). I\u2019ll highlight some changes that are already in the 0.9 source tree, and then write briefly about some changes that we hope will be ready soon.\n\n\n## Provably Prune-able Outputs\n\nThere have been huge debates in the past about embedding data in the blockchain; some people feel that the blockchain should be a public resource available to use for whatever people like, as long as they pay sufficient transaction fees to make it worthwhile for miners to store their transactions. Others feel that the blockchain should only contain the data necessary to validate bitcoin transactions, and any other data should be stored separately.\n\nAnd while the debates raged, clever people found lots of creative ways of embedding data into the block chain.\n\nSo, with some reluctance, I recently merged [pull request #2738](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/pull\/2738) : \u201cRelay OP_RETURN data TxOut as standard transaction type.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to give people a way to do what they clearly want to do (associate extra data with a transaction that is secured by the blockchain), but do it in a responsible way that strikes a balance between \u201cyou can put whatever you want into the blockchain\u201d and \u201cyou will have to be tricky and inefficient to get your data in the blockchain.\u201d\n\nPull request #2738 lets developers associate up to 80 bytes of arbitrary data with their transactions by adding an extra \u201cimmediately prune-able\u201d zero-valued output.\n\nWhy 80 bytes? Because we imagine that most uses will be to hash some larger data (perhaps a contract of some sort) and then embed the hash plus maybe a little bit of metadata into the output. But it is not large enough to do something silly like embed images or tweets.\n\nWhy allow any bytes at all? Because we can\u2019t stop people from adding one or more ordinary-looking-but-unspendable outputs to their transactions to embed arbitrary data in the blockchain.\n\nWhat do I mean by \u201cimmediately prune-able?\u201d The form of the up-to-80-byte transaction output (\u201cOP_RETURN <data>\u201d) is such that it can never be used as an input for another transaction\u2013 so it can theoretically be forgotten by everybody except for machines that want to keep a full record of every single transaction (\u201carchive nodes\u201d). That is a big improvement over the various hacks people are using today to associate data with their transactions, and will be more important in the future when we implement code that saves disk space by keeping only unspent transaction outputs and not every old block.\n\nThe core code has no easy way of creating these new transaction outputs\u2013 you have to create them yourself using the raw transactions API. And there are no plans to display the data in Bitcoin-Qt, so you don\u2019t have to worry about somebody sending you a few millibits and attaching a short-but-annoying message to the transaction.\n\n\n## Autotools\n\nLess controversial (I hope!) but more disruptive to core development: we\u2019ve switched from using hand-coded, platform-specific Makefiles and qmake to automatically generated with autotools Makefiles. Kudos to Cory Fields who did all the hard work to get everything working on Linux, Windows\/mingw, and OSX and then was patient and persistent enough to keep it working until everybody was comfortable making the switch. Using the standard \u201c.\/autogen.sh; .\/configure; make\u201d to build Bitcoin-Qt and bitcoind makes it easier for experienced open source developers to contribute to the project.\n\n\n## The Payment Protocol\n\nI\u2019m going to be lazy and point you to [the fantastic payment protocol FAQ](https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=300809.msg3225143#msg3225143 \"Payment Protocol FAQ\") written by Mike Hearn and posted to the bitcointalk forums. Writing something like that was on my mental TODO list, and I\u2019m very happy Mike went and did it instead!\n\n\n# Work in progress\n\nThese are all on the \u201chopefully going to make it into the 0.9 release\u201d list:\n\n\n## No-wallet mode and bitcoin-cli\n\nbitcoind is increasingly being used as an \u201cedge router\u201d \u2014 used as a firewall between the full Bitcoin peer-to-peer network and some custom wallet or mining software, to filter out any invalid blocks or transactions that might tickle bugs in the custom software\u2019s implementation of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\nThe 0.9 release should contain Jeff Garzik\u2019s [\u201c-disablewallet\u201d mode](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/pull\/2901), which lets bitcoind run entirely without a wallet, making startup faster and using less run-time memory.\n\nWe are (slowly) moving from a monolithic code base that does everything (wallet, RPC, network, blockchain storage\/validation) towards more modular internals with fewer dependencies between the different pieces. Another change you should see in the 0.9 release is moving away from the bitcoind executable functioning both as a server and as a RPC client\u2013 Wladimir J. van der Laan split the RPC client functionality (\u201ctell the running bitcoin daemon to do THIS\u201d) into a separate executable, \u2018bitcoin-cli\u2019. The RPC client code will eventually be removed from bitcoind, but will be kept for backwards compatibility for a release or two.\n\n\n## Headers-First, parallel download chain sync\n\nPieter Wuille has been busy working on further optimizing downloading the block chain\u2026 which will enable future work that makes downloading the entire chain optional. Once it has been thoroughly tested, we hope to merge \u201c[headers-first sync](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/pull\/2964)\u201d for the 0.9 release.\n\nThe idea of headers-first sync is to download the blockchain in two stages:\n\n1. Download just block headers from your peers. This is very quick, because each block header is just 80 bytes.\n\n2. Once you\u2019ve got one or more chains of block headers, pick the one with the most proof-of-work and then fetch just the full blocks for that chain.\n\nGetting the headers first makes it possible to implement parallel download of blocks from multiple peers, which increases performance. And it has security and privacy benefits, too\u2013an attacker can\u2019t make you waste space or time storing or serving an \u2018orphan\u2019 blockchain fragment that doesn\u2019t connect to the real blockchain.\n\n\n## Smarter transaction fees\n\nToday, transaction fees are hard-coded into the Bitcoin-Qt\/bitcoind wallet software, and the rules surrounding those fees are a collection of heuristics that evolved over the last four years. In short, the current fee-handling code is a complicated mess that will stop working as soon as transaction volume doubles a couple of more times.\n\nIn theory, it should be simple: transaction fees should to be set by a give-and-take between the people creating transactions (who want to pay as little as possible) and the people validating and storing the transactions (miners, who would like to be rewarded with higher fees).\n\nAnd the code that miners are using today to select transactions is simple: they fill their blocks with the highest fee-per-kilobyte transaction (and highest priority transactions, if they choose to set aside some space in their blocks for free transactions).\n\nI\u2019ve [been working on](https:\/\/github.com\/gavinandresen\/bitcoin-git\/commits\/smartfee) teaching the wallet code to estimate how low a fee (or priority) a transaction needs, at the moment it is sent, to be accepted by miners and included in the next block or three. The estimates are based on watching transactions as they are broadcast on the network and keeping track of which of those transactions are accepted into blocks.\n\nThe danger with estimating transaction fees is miners have an incentive to try to game the estimate to make transaction fees higher. For example, if the estimate was based on the average transaction fee for all transactions in the last N blocks, miners could add very-high-fee pay-to-self transactions to the blocks that they mine to drive up the average. However, by only considering fees for transactions that have been broadcast on the network that threat is eliminated\u2013 miners could broadcast very-high-fee pay-to-self transactions, but would end up paying those high transaction fees to other miners. The transaction estimation code also uses median transaction fees, not averages, to make it much harder for a minority of transactions to influence transaction fees.\n\nIf most of the miners got together and agreed to all broadcast lots of high transaction fee transactions they could succeed in driving up the average transaction fee\u2026 but that isn\u2019t going to happen because it would be easy for miners to \u201cfree ride\u201d by breaking the agreement and just collecting the higher transaction fees for themselves.\n\nAll of the above will work well for fully-validating software like Bitcoin-Qt\/bitcoind. More thinking is needed to figure out how lightweight simplified payment verification software (like Multibit) can better estimate transaction fees, because today they can\u2019t calculate how much transaction fee each transaction is paying.\n\n\n# So: 0.9 will be released\u2026\n\n\u2026 when it is ready.\n\nOur bottleneck is still code review and testing, so if you know C++ jump in, [read and comment on some pull requests](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/pulls), write some unit tests, and help shake out as many bugs as possible before the release.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know C++ but are comfortable running bleeding-edge code from the command line, downloading binaries created by the pull-tester, running them on the -testnet, and reporting any bugs (or reporting \u201cworks for me on Ubuntalicious 11.11 64-bit\u201d in the pull request) is very helpful.\n\nOther ways you can help: write a [test plan](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/QA\/blob\/master\/TestPlanCreation.md) for a pull request that you\u2019d like to see pulled. If you\u2019re really motivated to help get something into Bitcoin-Qt\/bitcoind, offer some Bitcoin bounties to the first person (or people) to run through a test plan and report success or failure; I\u2019ve had [good success](https:\/\/github.com\/gavinandresen\/QA\/blob\/master\/PaymentRequestTest.md) recruiting people from the #bitcoin IRC channel to do testing of major features by giving out modest (e.g. 0.11 BTC) bounties.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Since my <a title=\"Core Development Update #4\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/?p=204\">last update<\/a> at the end of June, the  core development team produced two minor bug-fix releases while working towards a major 0.9 release.

As of Christmas morning, BTC is holding steady around [$675](http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/).\n\nNow, before all of you say \u201cBitcoin is not all about the price\u201d, relax. You are correct. This year I\u2019ve been fortunate to have travelled all over the world evangelizing Bitcoin. From Austria to Las Vegas, Panama, California, London, Amsterdam, Morocco, Argentina and more meeting Bitcoin communities and building lifelong friendships. One thing I\u2019ll always remember, said to me by long time friend and Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck, \u201cBitcoin is the accumulation of the talent, hard work and dedication of the people who develop and maintain the protocol, build industries around the protocol, the merchants and consumers who use the Bitcoin protocol in their daily lives, and those who promote and protect the protocol. As more people become a part of the Bitcoin community, the value of the system increases.\u201d.\n\nBitcoin is not simply a currency, or a payment system. Bitcoin is a technology that enables you and I to work together to make the world a better place. Bitcoin not only has the potential for global financial inclusion of the world\u2019s poor, it also provides a stable money supply to people living in some of the world\u2019s most corrupt and irresponsible governments.\n\nWe\u2019ve had many ups and downs this year, literally. We saw the end of Silk Road and the dawn of government regulation. Some people thought we even found Satoshi. China emerged as a dominant player in the Bitcoin space. Senate hearings and various worldwide government bodies either embraced or tried to slow it down. I say good luck to that. To shut down Bitcoin you\u2019d have to shut down the world\u2019s electricity and the internet. Lastly, Canada and Australia joined the foundation\u2019s [initiative](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/?p=337) to bring together some of the most energetic Bitcoin communities in the world to fulfill our mission to protect, standardize and promote Bitcoin worldwide. Bitcoin is you, me, and all of our hard work. It\u2019s our community and culture that we\u2019ve all decided to make our own \u2013 and we will prevail.\n\nSatoshi built Bitcoin for us so we that can carry the torch and continue to develop it for mainstream adoption.

As of Christmas morning, BTC is holding steady around <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/\">$675<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now, before all of you say &#8220;Bitcoin is not all about the price&#8221;, relax. You are correct. This year I&#8217;ve been fortunate to have travelled all over the world evangelizing Bitcoin. From Austria to Las Vegas, Panama, California, London, Amsterdam, Morocco, Argentina and more meeting Bitcoin communities and building lifelong friendships. One thing I&#8217;ll always remember, said to me by long time friend and Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck, &#8220;Bitcoin is the accumulation of the talent, hard work and dedication of the people who develop and maintain the protocol, build industries around the protocol, the merchants and consumers who use the Bitcoin protocol in their daily lives, and those who promote and protect the protocol. As more people become a part of the Bitcoin community, the value of the system increases.&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin is not simply a currency, or a payment system. Bitcoin is a technology that enables you and I to work together to make the world a better place. Bitcoin not only has the potential for global financial inclusion of the world&#8217;s poor, it also provides a stable money supply to people living in some of the world&#8217;s most corrupt and irresponsible governments.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve had many ups and downs this year, literally. We saw the end of Silk Road and the dawn of government regulation. Some people thought we even found Satoshi. China emerged as a dominant player in the Bitcoin space. Senate hearings and various worldwide government bodies either embraced or tried to slow it down. I say good luck to that. To shut down Bitcoin you&#8217;d have to shut down the world&#8217;s electricity and the internet. Lastly, Canada and Australia joined the foundation&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/?p=337\">initiative<\/a> to bring together some of the most energetic Bitcoin communities in the world to fulfill our mission to protect, standardize and promote Bitcoin worldwide. Bitcoin is you, me, and all of our hard work. It&#8217;s our community and culture that we&#8217;ve all decided to make our own &#8211; and we will prevail.<\/p>\n<p>Satoshi built Bitcoin for us so we that can carry the torch and continue to develop it for mainstream adoption. He gave us the land and now its up to us the build the roads, bridges, and tunnels. 2013 was the year of regulation. 2014 is the year of infrastructure so get ready to build!

We\u2019re pleased to see the ongoing dialogue between FinCEN and the bitcoin community continue with these well-reasoned, informative clarifications.\n\nAs background on this type of administrative action, a federal agency (like FinCEN) may issue administrative rulings in response to inquiries submitted by individuals or businesses. Generally speaking, individuals or businesses may formally request that the agency clarify whether a certain activity or business model is subject to particular agency rules or regulations. After issuing an administrative ruling privately to the submitting party, the agency may then publish these rulings with certain sensitive information redacted.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">**FinCEN\u2019s March 2013**** Guidance**<\/span>\n\nIn March 2013, FinCEN issued guidance on how its rules apply to actors in the bitcoin space. The agency created three categories of possible actors:\n\n(1) Administrators: \u201ca person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) [bitcoins], and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) [bitcoins].\u201d\n\n(2) Exchangers: \u201ca person engaged as a business in the exchange of [bitcoins] for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency.\u201d\n\n(3) Users: \u201ca person that obtains [bitcoins] to purchase goods or services.\u201d\n\nUsers are not money services businesses (\u201cMSB\u201ds) under FinCEN regulations. However, an administrator or exchange is a MSB under the \u201cmoney transmitter\u201d category and subject to FinCEN regulations if it does one of two things: (1) \u201caccepts and transmits\u201d bitcoins; or (2) \u201cbuys or sells\u201d bitcoins.\n\nFinCEN\u2019s guidance was not exactly clear as to how the various actors in the bitcoin community fit into this structure. Some were concerned that it created a dynamic where miners who used the bitcoins they mined to purchase goods or services were \u201cusers\u201d, but miners who sold the bitcoins they mined for real currency were money transmitters. Thankfully, today\u2019s ruling helps straighten this out in a sensible way.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">**Miners**<\/span>\n\nFinCEN\u2019s [first administrative ruling](http:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/news_room\/rp\/rulings\/pdf\/FIN-2014-R001.pdf) stated that a company that mines bitcoins can use their mined bitcoins to purchase goods or services and pay the company\u2019s debts (including to owners and for shareholder distributions), or convert the bitcoins into legal tender currency and use that legal tender currency to pay debts or purchase goods or services for the comapny\u2019s benefit, without being a MSB. FinCEN explained that when an individual or a company uses bitcoins that it mined for itself for its own benefit that the company has neither accepted nor transmitted and, thus, does not entail money transmission. (p. 3) Furthermore, when the individual or company converts its mined bitcoins into legal tender currency or other convertible virtual currencies, it is not acting as an exchanger so long as the transaction is for the individual or company\u2019s own benefit, and not done as a service for a third party. (p. 3) More pointedly: \u201cA user\u2019s conversion of Bitcoin into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, therefore, does not in and of itself make the user a money transmitter.\u201d (p. 3) FinCEN does note that if a user sends its bitcoins to a third party at the direction of a seller or creditor, such activity may constitute money transmission. (p. 3)\n\nInterestingly, part of FinCEN\u2019s analysis noted that the method by which a person or company receives bitcoins (whether it be by mining, purchasing or earning) is \u201cnot material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or the person engaging in the process\u201d of sending bitcoins to another person or place. (p. 2) Instead, what is material is \u201cwhat the person uses the [bitcoins] for, and for whose benefit.\u201d (p. 2) The application of these concepts here could easily be analogized to those who purchase bitcoins and those who earn bitcoins as wages, and may offer a glimpse of FinCEN\u2019s thinking on those matters as well.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">**Virtual Currency Software Development and Certain Investment Activity**<\/span>\n\nFinCEN\u2019s [second administrative ruling](http:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/news_room\/rp\/rulings\/pdf\/FIN-2014-R002.pdf) looked at two things: (1) whether a company would be a MSB if it created software to facilitate its purchase of virtual currency from sellers for purposes of its own investment when such software automates the collection and payment of legal tender currency to the seller of virtual currency; and (2) whether a company\u2019s periodic investment in convertible virtual currencies would make the company a MSB.\n\nFinCEN first addresses the software development inquiry by stating that the mere production and distribution of software \u201cwould not constitute acceptance and transmission of value, even if the purpose of the software is to facilitate the sale of virtual currency.\u201d (p. 2) As such, the company would not be a MSB and would not be subject to FinCEN\u2019s rules. However, since these administrative rulings are responses to particular business models, it should be noted the software in this case would only be used by the company and its counterparties, and not sold to third parties.\n\nFinCEN went on to address whether investing in convertible virtual currencies would make someone a MSB. Simply put, the answer is no, so long as the investor is investing on its own account and not on behalf of others. (p. 4) If any transfers to third parties occur, then money transmission may be occurring. Putting a finer point on it, FinCEN notes that providing investment services to third parties may indeed make the company a MSB and the provision of exchange services would in fact make the company a MSB. (p. 4)\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">**Takeaway**<\/span>\n\nWhen making a ruling on whether or not an individual or business falls into one of the three defined categories under the virtual currency guidance, FinCEN will key on who benefits from a given activity. In both rulings, the use of bitcoin, or other convertible virtual currency, was for the benefit of a single party (the actor\u2019s own benefit) and in both cases that meant that the actor fell under the \u201cUser\u201d category and was therefore not a MSB. FinCEN explicitly noted that actors may be either \u201cExchangers\u201d or \u201cAdministrators\u201d if third parties are involved in any transactions.\n\nThe biggest takeaway for the bitcoin community should be this: FinCEN will listen and reply and give you clear guidance if you ask them about your business model. That sort of clarity is a big step down the path of creating a sane regulatory environment.\n\n\n","html":"<p>The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;), part of the U.S. Treasury, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/news_room\/nr\/html\/20140130.html\" target=\"_blank\">issued two administrative rulings<\/a> today clarifying application of their <a href=\"http:\/\/fincen.gov\/statutes_regs\/guidance\/html\/FIN-2013-G001.html\" target=\"_blank\">March 18, 2013 guidance<\/a> to two bitcoin business models.

After issuing an administrative ruling privately to the submitting party, the agency may then publish these rulings with certain sensitive information redacted.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>FinCEN&#8217;s March 2013<\/strong><strong> Guidance<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>In March 2013, FinCEN issued guidance on how its rules apply to actors in the bitcoin space. The agency created three categories of possible actors:<\/p>\n<p>(1) Administrators: &#8220;a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) [bitcoins], and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) [bitcoins].&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(2) Exchangers: &#8220;a person engaged as a business in the exchange of [bitcoins] for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>(3) Users: &#8220;a person that obtains [bitcoins] to purchase goods or services.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Users are not money services businesses (&#8220;MSB&#8221;s) under FinCEN regulations. However, an administrator or exchange is a MSB under the &#8220;money transmitter&#8221; category and subject to FinCEN regulations if it does one of two things: (1) &#8220;accepts and transmits&#8221; bitcoins; or (2) &#8220;buys or sells&#8221; bitcoins.<\/p>\n<p>FinCEN&#8217;s guidance was not exactly clear as to how the various actors in the bitcoin community fit into this structure. Some were concerned that it created a dynamic where miners who used the bitcoins they mined to purchase goods or services were &#8220;users&#8221;, but miners who sold the bitcoins they mined for real currency were money transmitters. Thankfully, today&#8217;s ruling helps straighten this out in a sensible way.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Miners<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>FinCEN&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/news_room\/rp\/rulings\/pdf\/FIN-2014-R001.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">first administrative ruling<\/a> stated that a company that mines bitcoins can use their mined bitcoins to purchase goods or services and pay the company&#8217;s debts (including to owners and for shareholder distributions), or convert the bitcoins into legal tender currency and use that legal tender currency to pay debts or purchase goods or services for the comapny&#8217;s benefit, without being a MSB. FinCEN explained that when an individual or a company uses bitcoins that it mined for itself for its own benefit that the company has neither accepted nor transmitted and, thus, does not entail money transmission. (p. 3) Furthermore, when the individual or company converts its mined bitcoins into legal tender currency or other convertible virtual currencies, it is not acting as an exchanger so long as the transaction is for the individual or company&#8217;s own benefit, and not done as a service for a third party. (p. 3) More pointedly: &#8220;A user&#8217;s conversion of Bitcoin into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, therefore, does not in and of itself make the user a money transmitter.&#8221; (p. 3) FinCEN does note that if a user sends its bitcoins to a third party at the direction of a seller or creditor, such activity may constitute money transmission. (p. 3)<\/p>\n<p>Interestingly, part of FinCEN&#8217;s analysis noted that the method by which a person or company receives bitcoins (whether it be by mining, purchasing or earning) is &#8220;not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or the person engaging in the process&#8221; of sending bitcoins to another person or place. (p. 2) Instead, what is material is &#8220;what the person uses the [bitcoins] for, and for whose benefit.&#8221; (p. 2) The application of these concepts here could easily be analogized to those who purchase bitcoins and those who earn bitcoins as wages, and may offer a glimpse of FinCEN&#8217;s thinking on those matters as well.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Virtual Currency Software Development and Certain Investment Activity<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>FinCEN&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fincen.gov\/news_room\/rp\/rulings\/pdf\/FIN-2014-R002.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">second administrative ruling<\/a> looked at two things: (1) whether a company would be a MSB if it created software to facilitate its purchase of virtual currency from sellers for purposes of its own investment when such software automates the collection and payment of legal tender currency to the seller of virtual currency; and (2) whether a company&#8217;s periodic investment in convertible virtual currencies would make the company a MSB.<\/p>\n<p>FinCEN first addresses the software development inquiry by stating that the mere production and distribution of software &#8220;would not constitute acceptance and transmission of value, even if the purpose of the software is to facilitate the sale of virtual currency.&#8221; (p. 2) As such, the company would not be a MSB and would not be subject to FinCEN&#8217;s rules. However, since these administrative rulings are responses to particular business models, it should be noted the software in this case would only be used by the company and its counterparties, and not sold to third parties.<\/p>\n<p>FinCEN went on to address whether investing in convertible virtual currencies would make someone a MSB. Simply put, the answer is no, so long as the investor is investing on its own account and not on behalf of others. (p. 4) If any transfers to third parties occur, then money transmission may be occurring. Putting a finer point on it, FinCEN notes that providing investment services to third parties may indeed make the company a MSB and the provision of exchange services would in fact make the company a MSB. (p. 4)<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Takeaway<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p>When making a ruling on whether or not an individual or business falls into one of the three defined categories under the virtual currency guidance, FinCEN will key on who benefits from a given activity. In both rulings, the use of bitcoin, or other convertible virtual currency, was for the benefit of a single party (the actor&#8217;s own benefit) and in both cases that meant that the actor fell under the &#8220;User&#8221; category and was therefore not a MSB. FinCEN explicitly noted that actors may be either &#8220;Exchangers&#8221; or &#8220;Administrators&#8221; if third parties are involved in any transactions.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest takeaway for the bitcoin community should be this: FinCEN will listen and reply and give you clear guidance if you ask them about your business model. That sort of clarity is a big step down the path of creating a sane regulatory environment.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":17,"created_at":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 22:35:41 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 09 Jul 2014 15:44:51 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 30 Jan 2014 22:35:41 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":16159,"title":"Q2 2013 Grant Awardee Coinpunk Update and Q1 Grant Deadline","slug":"q2-2013-grant-awardee-coinpunk-update-and-q1-grant-deadline","markdown":"\nIn 2013, we saw a lot of great ideas come in through our grant program.

As such, here is a brief outline of what will be expected of a board member:\n\n- Review and abide by the by laws. The bylaws are the basis for the organizational structure of the Foundation, and all board members must be well versed in their details and impacts on Foundation business.\n- Attend all board meetings. Board members are expected to attend all board meetings. Currently, our regular meetings occur once per month via video conference and are scheduled to accommodate a wide range of time zones of the participants. Interim meetings may also be required from time to time.\n- Occasional travel may be required. Board members may at times be required to travel on behalf of the Foundation. Approved travel costs will be paid by the Foundation.\n- Perform officer roles as assigned. Board members can be assigned officer roles in addition to basic board obligations, and are responsible for all tasks related to those roles as outlined in the bylaws.\n- Act in the best interest of the Foundation and its members. As the public faces of the Foundation, board members should conduct themselves responsibly in addition to actively seeking to further the goals of the Foundation.\n\nIf you are an industry member or know of an industry member who would be interested in serving on the Board of Directors, we are happy to discuss further with you what the expectations and responsibilities of being a member of the board entails.

Bitcoin\u2019s design is intentionally decentralized in many ways. Certainly the blockchain operation and P2P network, but it is more than that. Bitcoin blockchain data is zero trust.

The designer, operating under a presumed pseudonym, reinforced this. There was no need to know and trust Satoshi Nakamoto. The design stood by itself, open to inspection by all. Satoshi Nakamoto ultimately created a \u201clanguage\u201d of sorts with the bitcoin protocol. A network protocol, like Bitcoin, is nothing more than a common lingua franca enabling multiple parties to communicate usefully with each other. Much like other spoken languages around the world, the bitcoin protocol grows and changes as its users change, ultimately controlled by no one.\n\nThe Bitcoin project is decentralized. It has no leader by design. Each community member contributes and collaborates with others based on his or her own needs, choices and free will. Bitcoin\u2019s reference implementation has a chief scientist, but ultimately leadership always rests in the hands of every bitcoin user. The Bitcoin Foundation is opening affiliate chapters around the world, and others are organizing their own Bitcoin groups in a decentralized fashion. The Bitcoin Foundation is a Bitcoin leader, but certainly not *the* Bitcoin leader.\n\nSatoshi\u2019s identity may or may not be revealed in time. Based on current research from Sergio Lerner, Satoshi does not appear to have moved or spent any Bitcoins. Satoshi is unlikely to be sitting on a beach in Tahiti, next to a multi-million dollar mansion. Satoshi is unlikely to be prepared for determined, potentially violent thieves and curiosity seekers. Curiosity in Satoshi\u2019s identity is understandable, but please consider responsible disclosure, and the danger such a revelation may generate.\n\nThe Bitcoin protocol would not exist without Satoshi, who is without question a brilliant designer. However, Bitcoin will endure well past Satoshi, as Bitcoin is everyone who uses it, not just one person.\n\n**About \/\/ ***Jeff Garzik is an engineer, blogger, futurist and entrepreneur.

Bitcoin.org is an invaluable resource for the greater Bitcoin community; they are a gateway to the network for new users, a portal for alerts regarding network events, a meeting point for developers and media as well as a beacon providing greater visibility to the larger Bitcoin ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u201cI have always personally admired the work of those who dedicate their time freely to provide this excellent resource for the Bitcoin community and anyone who is trying to learn about Bitcoin. It\u2019s an honor for the foundation to be able to support their work,\u201d said Jon Matonis, Executive Director.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;Improving international accessibility is one of the goals of our partnership. As a global network, Bitcoin has the potential to provide fair access to a universal payment system across political and geographic borders &#8212; especially in areas that are traditionally under-served or over-looked by the financial services industry. In addition, our partnership strengthens our commitment to international users by providing for more translations of important information relating to the network.

I write today to introduce myself here on the blog and share some early thinking about the work I\u2019ll be doing.\n\nYou can anticipate that I\u2019ll post here routinely about issues large and small. I also plan to be a good citizen on the [forums](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/forum\/), so if you want to interact with me, plan to do so there. (I can\u2019t promise you all-day, every-day, of course.) If you want a window onto what interests me and a chance to read my peculiar comments about random things, my Twitter handle is [@Jim_Harper](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jim_Harper). If you want to hang out, by all means [come to Bitcoin 2014](http:\/\/bitcoin2014.com\/) in the Netherlands May 15 through 17. Everyone who is someone in Bitcoin will be there.\n\nMy first interaction with the foundation was back in April of last year when General Counsel Patrick Murck sent me a note complimenting a blog post I had written entitled \u201c[What is the Value of Bitcoin?](http:\/\/www.cato.org\/blog\/what-value-bitcoin)\u201d I was riffing on excitement about a Bitcoin price spike against the U.S. dollar to try to get people thinking more carefully about money. (I still think that post is pretty good, but I know more now than I did then.) Patrick\u2019s kind words began a conversation that lead to my becoming a member of the foundation, serving as an informal advisor, joining Patrick and other foundation leaders in briefing U.S. federal financial regulators, and now coming on board at the foundation.\n\nThat post was on [Cato@Liberty](http:\/\/www.cato.org\/blog), the house blog of the [Cato Institute](http:\/\/www.cato.org\/), where since 2004 I\u2019ve been director of information policy studies. Prior to Cato, I had my own lobbying\/consulting firm, and prior to that, I worked on Capitol Hill, serving in a number of roles including as counsel to committees in both the U.S. House and Senate. I\u2019m a California native, and the sad, sad joke, which gets sadder every year, is that I\u2019m nineteen years into my two-year stint in Washington, D.C\u2026\n\nThe issues I\u2019ve handled at Cato include privacy, telecommunications, intellectual property, cybersecurity, government transparency, and counterterrorism policy (so often non-transparent and privacy-invasive). I\u2019ll be continuing as a senior fellow. On Monday, my Cato colleague Ilya Shapiro and I [invited the Court](http:\/\/www.cato.org\/publications\/legal-briefs\/riley-v-california) to use a sound Fourth Amendment framework to protect data held on cell phones. In the transparency area, I run a web site called [WashingtonWatch.com](http:\/\/www.washingtonwatch.com\/).\n\nI\u2019ll save you time doing your own research: My personal philosophy is libertarian. That means a lot of things, and the opportunity for worldwide advancement of liberty is definitely one of things that got me engaged with Bitcoin. But what really excites me\u2014what tugs at my heartstrings\u2014is Bitcoin\u2019s potential to improve global financial inclusion. There are billions of people who, through no fault of their own, can\u2019t access formal financial services, so they have a harder time earning, a harder time saving, a harder time feeding their families, and a harder time educating their children.\n\nThink about that phrase: \u201cglobal financial inclusion.\u201d Why on earth, in this day and age, should anyone be \u201cexcluded\u201d from participating in economic activity that improves their lives? It\u2019s kind of galling to look at the status quo for so many people in the world when you know how things could be. Bitcoin may help.\n\nI also find galling the effect of inflation on the poor. Smarties like you and I can invest our way out of inflation\u2019s gravitational pull, but even in rich countries, inflation acts as a constant drain on what wealth the poor and under-educated can pull together. Productivity growth should naturally cause the price of goods and services to fall, making wage-earners better off whether they get a raise or not. But when inflation is at its best, keeping prices steady, that delivers the benefits of productivity growth to business owners rather than workers. How is that fair?\n\nI understand the argument that money supplies should be managed, and that they can be managed well. All I need is for people holding that position to accept an empirical test: Let Bitcoin compete.\n\nOK. That \u201cwhy I care about Bitcoin\u201d stuff brushed up against just a few of the many public policy issues that face Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin businesses, and the broader Bitcoin community. We do not lack for things to do that might protect and defend Bitcoin. My plan is not to do them all, but rather to prioritize well, and to do the things that remove the most significant impediments to Bitcoin\u2019s success.\n\nTo that end\u2014prioritizing\u2014I have already begun a study of the risks that Bitcoin faces and their severity, how to address them and, when possible, how to measure success or failure. I expect to publish this study soon, I\u2019ll present it at Bitcoin 2014 (have you [signed up yet](http:\/\/bitcoin2014.com\/)?), and I hope to repeat it regularly with input from the foundation\u2019s membership. I think this methodology will cause the Bitcoin Foundation to rise above other organizations working in public policy because, frankly, most public policy work doesn\u2019t follow a methodology at all.\n\nWhile managing the issues that exist now, I\u2019ll look out on the horizon for issues we can head off before they become fires in the Bitcoin ecosystem. We\u2019ll use all the tools we need, but we won\u2019t take lobbyists\u2019 advice on how much we should lobby. We\u2019ll use the power of the Bitcoin community more than the money of the Bitcoin community. And I don\u2019t plan to measure our success by counting up the number of meetings we\u2019ve had with politicians and regulators, by tallying the money we\u2019ve spent on lobbying, or\u2014heaven forfend\u2014by counting how much in donations we\u2019ve delivered to politicians.\n\nThere are good politicians out there, and I\u2019ll salute U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-DE) for his early and even-keeled handling of Bitcoin as chairman of the U.S. Senate\u2019s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. His hearing on Bitcoin last fall set the tone for the entire Washington, D.C., Beltway and increasingly for the nation as a whole: the United States is going to seek the benefits of Bitcoin while mitigating the risks.\n\nSenator Carper didn\u2019t act in a vacuum, of course. Patrick Murck was in Washington countless times over many months meeting with officials in various federal offices to educate them about the Bitcoin protocol and its many potential uses, to make clear that there are sophisticated investors and business-builders coming into the Bitcoin space, and to help hammer out where Bitcoin fits into existing legal rules. (Don\u2019t let them tell you Bitcoin is \u201cunregulated.\u201d) Marco Santori, Brian Klein, and Mike Hearn have been doing their part, too, as chairs of relevant Bitcoin Foundation committees.\n\nWith news coming out regularly about various governments and agencies \u201ccautioning\u201d their people about Bitcoin, often reported in dramatic terms, you might think things are going badly. Well, you haven\u2019t thought about how bad things could be. The relatively favorable climate for Bitcoin in Washington, D.C. is largely attributable to Patrick\u2019s work, which has gone largely unsung, and Jinyoung England\u2019s tireless communications work, aided by Amy Weiss in recent months. I step into my role with the Bitcoin Foundation on strong footing compared to where we would be if not for the foundation\u2019s good work.\n\nWhile maintaining and increasing the gains we\u2019ve seen in Washington, D.C., I\u2019ll be branching out. I plan to work on policy issues at a level of abstraction high enough that my work can be translated for use by the foundation\u2019s growing roster of international partners and affiliates. Is Bitcoin anonymous, pseudonymous, privacy-protective, or privacy-destructive? Policymakers around the world need to understand these concepts. What\u2019s the interaction going to be between Bitcoin and law enforcement? That\u2019s an issue every country will grapple with. What protects consumers when they use Bitcon for payments, or when they store Bitcoins with a service provider? Consumers around the world obviously need to know.\n\nThe idea is not to make Bitcoin a big deal in political capitols. Bitcoin is a non-political currency. The idea is for Bitcoiners to build technologies and businesses that solve problems, create wealth, and deliver Bitcoin\u2019s benefits far and wide.\n\nEvents in the last few months have shown the acute need for better security, sounder and more mature Bitcoin businesses, and wider consumer adoption. We all have our part to play. My goal is to keep you, the Bitcoin community, free to make those things happen\u2014free to transact on your own terms.\n\n[**Update:** This \u2018smarty\u2019 is not so smart!

As a major version it introduces both new features and bug fixes.\n\nThe full [list of changes](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/bin\/0.9.0\/README.txt \"list of changes\") is huge and it is too much to mention everything in this blog post. I will highlight a few prominent changes from a user perspective.\n\n\n## Payment requests\n\nPayment requests are Bitcoin invoices. They were introduced (in [BIP 70)](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bips\/blob\/master\/bip-0070.mediawiki \"BIP 0070\") to solve the limitations of Bitcoin URIs and provide a safe and flexible payment solution. For example a refund address is automatically provided to the merchant to be able to refund the order when something goes wrong. Payment requests can be also be cryptographically signed to make sure that the payment goes to the intended recipient.\n\nThe payment requests can be sent by a website (as a link) but also sent over mail or any other communication medium that supports file attachments. When opening a payment request is will be shown like this:\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_547\" style=\"width: 310px\">[![Signed and verified payment request](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/payment_request-300x77.png)](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/payment_request.png)A signed and succesfully verified payment request will be shown in green\n\n<\/div>The payment request functionality in 0.9.0 is a first iteration. In upcoming releases the user experience and functionality will be fine-tuned. For merchants it is recommended to migrate to using payment requests as soon as possible. Various other Bitcoin wallets, as well as payment providers [such as Bitpay](http:\/\/blog.bitpay.com\/2014\/02\/20\/bitpay-launches-payment-protocol-support.html \"Bitpay launches payment protocol support\") have already added support.\n\n\n## Rebranding to Bitcoin Core\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_548\" style=\"width: 310px\">[![The rebranded splash screen](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bitcoin_core-300x200.png)](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bitcoin_core.png)The rebranded splash screen\n\n<\/div>A long time ago the Bitcoin reference implementation was the only implementation of Bitcoin.\n\nThis time is long past and today quite a few alternative clients exist, which makes it ever more important to distinguish between Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software.\n\nFor this reason the Bitcoin reference client has been rebranded with 0.9.0. The new name is *Bitcoin Core*.\n\nThe name \u201cCore\u201d highlights the purpose of the software to run the core infrastructure of the Bitcoin network.

Over the next releases, non-core functionality (such as the wallet) will be split off to different projects to allow independent collaboration and release cycles.\n\n\n## New receive coins workflow\n\n<div class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" id=\"attachment_549\" style=\"width: 310px\">[![The new overhauled receive tab](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/new_receive_tab-300x184.png)](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/new_receive_tab.png)The new overhauled receive tab\n\n<\/div>A more convenient workflow has been introduced for receiving coins. The *Receive* tab has been replaced with a form in which an invoice can be created.\n\nLet\u2019s say that you want to request a payment from someone.

It is possible to get the full list of receiving addresses as before through *Receiving Addresses\u2026* in the *File* menu.\n\n\n## Coin control\n\nCoin Control is a new feature for advanced users that allows manual control over coin selection. Every time that you receive coins, a new unspent output is added to the wallet. These outputs (\u201ccoins\u201d) are combined as necessary for outgoing payments. Normally this selection process happens automatically and outside control of the user. With Coin Control, the user can select which unspent outputs to use as inputs to an transaction.

I will highlight a few prominent changes from a user perspective.<\/p>\n<h2>Payment requests<\/h2>\n<p>Payment requests are Bitcoin invoices. They were introduced (in <a title=\"BIP 0070\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bips\/blob\/master\/bip-0070.mediawiki\" target=\"_blank\">BIP 70)<\/a> to solve the limitations of Bitcoin URIs and provide a safe and flexible payment solution. For example a refund address is automatically provided to the merchant to be able to refund the order when something goes wrong. Payment requests can be also be cryptographically signed to make sure that the payment goes to the intended recipient.<\/p>\n<p>The payment requests can be sent by a website (as a link) but also sent over mail or any other communication medium that supports file attachments. When opening a payment request is will be shown like this:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_547\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/payment_request.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-547 \" alt=\"Signed and verified payment request\" src=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/payment_request-300x77.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"77\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A signed and succesfully verified payment request will be shown in green<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The payment request functionality in 0.9.0 is a first iteration. In upcoming releases the user experience and functionality will be fine-tuned. For merchants it is recommended to migrate to using payment requests as soon as possible. Various other Bitcoin wallets, as well as payment providers <a title=\"Bitpay launches payment protocol support\" href=\"http:\/\/blog.bitpay.com\/2014\/02\/20\/bitpay-launches-payment-protocol-support.html\" target=\"_blank\">such as Bitpay<\/a> have already added support.<\/p>\n<h2>Rebranding to Bitcoin Core<\/h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_548\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bitcoin_core.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-548 \" alt=\"The rebranded splash screen\" src=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/bitcoin_core-300x200.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The rebranded splash screen<\/p><\/div>\n<p>A long time ago the Bitcoin reference implementation was the only implementation of Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>This time is long past and today quite a few alternative clients exist, which makes it ever more important to distinguish between Bitcoin-the-network and Bitcoin-the-software.<\/p>\n<p>For this reason the Bitcoin reference client has been rebranded with 0.9.0. The new name is <em>Bitcoin Core<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The name &#8220;Core&#8221; highlights the purpose of the software to run the core infrastructure of the Bitcoin network.

But regulators\u2019 warnings risk being over-interpreted. What appears to be an anti-Bitcoin tide is just a lot of people doing their jobs. Multiple warnings about the same issues can be wearying, but they do not signify trouble in Bitcoin-land.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the dynamics around regulators\u2019 warnings, and reporting about those warnings, to get things in perspective. We\u2019ll use the U.S. state of Massachusetts as an example.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, the second bitcoin ATM in Massachusetts \u2014 and apparently just the fourth in the [United States] \u2014 opened at the Clover Food Lab restaurant in Harvard Square,\u201d [reports the *Boston Globe*](http:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/business\/2014\/03\/18\/bitcoin\/5G7ygVFrSQFdyaAhXJpn1J\/story.html). \u201cThe company that installed and operates the machine, Liberty Teller of Boston, placed its first kiosk at South Station in Boston in February.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s good news! But the title of the article is \u201c**Mass. regulators warn about bitcoin**.\u201d\n\nBitcoin is exciting and interesting, and the folks at Liberty Teller want people to know about their cool new tellers. Maybe they called the *Globe*, or maybe reporter Kyle Alspach saw it on his way through Harvard Square munching a bagel. Or perhaps he checks government Web sites for warnings every day, poor guy. Whatever the case, it was time for a news article.\n\nWhat does a good reporter do when he\u2019s writing an article about something interesting and new? Call around to get people\u2019s comments.\n\nAlspach knows Bitcoin pretty well, having written articles about it [before](http:\/\/upstart.bizjournals.com\/money\/loot\/2013\/11\/02\/jeremy-allaire-on-his-plan-to-take.html?page=all). But he did all the right things for this story, too. He called a Boston lawyer who has written about digital currency issues, he called the Massachusetts Bankers Association, and he called the undersecretary of consumer affairs and business regulation in Massachusetts, Barbara Anthony.\n\nI don\u2019t know, of course, whether Anthony and her colleagues had already issued their caution about Bitcoin when Alspach called. When Bitcoin ATMs started going in, they probably knew that someone would call to ask soon. Either way, the department put out a [consumer alert](http:\/\/www.mass.gov\/ocabr\/media\/advisories\/bitcoin-advisory.html) Tuesday that cautions people in a straightforward way about Bitcoin. Among other points the warning makes are: Bitcoin\u2019s price against government currencies is volatile. It doesn\u2019t have the consumer protections of other payment systems. It is not insured. There are security risks. These are all true statements that should warn uninformed consumers away from buying large amounts of Bitcoin.\n\nOne might wish for a more encouraging tone. Maybe the last line of a regulator\u2019s warning could say, \u201cBut you know what? Bitcoin is going to lower the cost of financial services and increase competition, so that everyone is better off! It\u2019ll bring billions of unbanked people around the world into a financial services system that allows them to accumulate wealth, feed their children, and send their kids to school!\u201d Alas, that\u2019s just not the business regulators are in.\n\nBack to the *Boston Globe*. The old adage is true: \u201cIf it bleeds, it leads.\u201d So Alspach wrote the story to highlight potential conflict between Bitcoin ATMs and regulators. The headline writer\u2014usually a different person\u2014did the same. There is room in the world for feature stories, including about cool new tech with world-changing potential, but this is news, and news needs conflict. So the *Globe* story, like so many others, highlights the negative.\n\n[![KCandBO](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/KCandBO-257x300.png)](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/KCandBO.png)The repetition of these stories\u2014each time a regulator, central banker, or other organization says something cautionary\u2014may create the appearance of a rising tide. But it\u2019s just repetition of the same warnings about the same issues, and the news stories are all produced in the same controversy-heightening atmosphere.\n\nThe warnings themselves deal with real issues that people are working on, and these issues will diminish in significance over time. The Bitcoin protocol is solid. Social and economic habits, practices, and institutions will take some time adjusting to it and learning how to maximize Bitcoin\u2019s benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea: maximizing Bitcoin\u2019s benefits while minimizing the risks. So if you\u2019re worried or frustrated by regulators\u2019 warnings or the reporting about them, another adage applies: Keep calm and #Bitcoin on.\n\n\n","html":"<p>In an interview yesterday, a reporter asked me about the many warnings that regulators and others have issued about Bitcoin: &#8220;Are the warnings overstated?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In general, I don&#8217;t think they are.

Maybe the last line of a regulator&#8217;s warning could say, &#8220;But you know what? Bitcoin is going to lower the cost of financial services and increase competition, so that everyone is better off! It&#8217;ll bring billions of unbanked people around the world into a financial services system that allows them to accumulate wealth, feed their children, and send their kids to school!&#8221; Alas, that&#8217;s just not the business regulators are in.<\/p>\n<p>Back to the <em>Boston Globe<\/em>. The old adage is true: &#8220;If it bleeds, it leads.&#8221; So Alspach wrote the story to highlight potential conflict between Bitcoin ATMs and regulators. The headline writer&#8212;usually a different person&#8212;did the same. There is room in the world for feature stories, including about cool new tech with world-changing potential, but this is news, and news needs conflict. So the <em>Globe<\/em> story, like so many others, highlights the negative.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/KCandBO.png\"><img src=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/KCandBO-257x300.png\" alt=\"KCandBO\" width=\"257\" height=\"300\" align=\"right\" \/><\/a>The repetition of these stories&#8212;each time a regulator, central banker, or other organization says something cautionary&#8212;may create the appearance of a rising tide. But it&#8217;s just repetition of the same warnings about the same issues, and the news stories are all produced in the same controversy-heightening atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>The warnings themselves deal with real issues that people are working on, and these issues will diminish in significance over time. The Bitcoin protocol is solid. Social and economic habits, practices, and institutions will take some time adjusting to it and learning how to maximize Bitcoin&#8217;s benefits.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the idea: maximizing Bitcoin&#8217;s benefits while minimizing the risks. So if you&#8217;re worried or frustrated by regulators&#8217; warnings or the reporting about them, another adage applies: Keep calm and #Bitcoin on.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 15:55:36 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 11:29:09 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Thu, 20 Mar 2014 15:55:36 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":16175,"title":"Welcome new Gold Member: BitPay","slug":"welcome-new-gold-member-bitpay","markdown":"\n<div><div><div dir=\"auto\"><div><div><div dir=\"auto\"><div><div><div dir=\"auto\">The Bitcoin Foundation would like to welcome new Gold Member, BitPay Inc.

The foundation\u2019s work to standardize, protect, and promote Bitcoin is fostering the development of a new economic, commercial, and (in some respects) social system, so there\u2019s no end to the things we might do. Prioritizing our efforts is key. So today, I\u2019m pleased to announce the release of my study, which should aid in that prioritization. The study is called *[*Removing Impediments to Bitcoin\u2019s Success*](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/static\/2014\/04\/Bitcoin-Risk-Management-Study-Spring-2014.pdf)*.\n\nIt is essentially an orthodox risk management study. The study first seeks to capture what makes Bitcoin an asset worth protecting. (Bitcoin is obviously very special, but can you say exactly why?) Then the study calculates the threats to Bitcoin in each of its key dimensions, based on interviews I conducted with Bitcoin Foundation leaders in the course of getting to know them last year. The major threats are graphed in terms of likelihood and consequence, pushing the most important ones to the top. Finally, the study groups together areas of risk, identifying potential measures of success or failure in efforts to respond to them. [Take a look](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/static\/2014\/04\/Bitcoin-Risk-Management-Study-Spring-2014.pdf).\n\nI\u2019ll be presenting and discussing the study at the [#Bitcoin2014](http:\/\/bitcoin2014.com\/) conference, which is happening May 15-17 in Amsterdam, and I hope to repeat the study regularly with input from the foundation\u2019s membership. (If you\u2019re a non-member, it\u2019s probably [time to change that](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/support)!) A project like this should never be treated as final. It will evolve and improve over time.\n\nI\u2019m a big believer in risk management, if only because of the years I\u2019ve spent criticizing organizations that fail to do risk management well. There are entities that say they are risk-based, but they waste millions of dollars in some instances and needlessly imperil privacy and civil liberties.\n\nI\u2019m mostly talking about the U.S. government\u2019s [Transportation Security Administration](http:\/\/www.cato.org\/blog\/strip-or-grope-vs-risk-management). But maladministration is not only seen in some government agencies. It also shows up in government relations and lobbying because this, too, is an area where goods and services don\u2019t have easy measures of price and quality.\n\n[Public choice economics](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Public_choice) first identified the dynamics at play in these fields with respect to elected officials. We may wish them to be disinterested public servants, but the better theory is that they prioritize their own interests, such as in reelection. That certainly doesn\u2019t mean they always act contrary to the public interest. They promote the interests of their constituents much of the time. But too often they don\u2019t. My late Cato Institute colleague William Niskanen extended this theory to government agencies in his book, [*Bureaucracy and Public Economics*](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bureaucracy-Public-Economics-Locke-Series\/dp\/1858980410), showing that government agencies seek to maximize their discretionary budgets.\n\nPrivate-sector organizations can be bureaucracies, and market-driven organizations can have bureaucracies in them (\u201cbureaucracy\u201d in the non-pejorative, economic sense\u2014not sayin\u2019 it to be mean!) Government affairs and lobbying is such an area, where interests can get badly misaligned.\n\nIn the worst cases, I\u2019ve seen government relations personnel working in Washington, D.C., to produce additional public policy challenges for the industry or clients they represent. Lobbyists routinely groom their clients and friends to help the politicians or party they align with, regardless of whether that improves outcomes. They may believe that they are doing the right thing, but what is certain when they gin up issues and deliver their clients to their political patrons is that they produce bigger budgets for their projects or departments and job security and political relationships for themselves.\n\nThe worst of it for me is watching business leaders\u2014masters of the universe in their fields\u2014doing such a poor job as consumers of government relations. Lacking other indicators, they seem to treat price as a signal of quality, and they shovel money into projects, firms, and campaigns, often achieving no useful end. It seems like the sophisticated thing to do, and it\u2019s what everyone else is doing, so I suppose they think it\u2019s the game they have to play.\n\nI don\u2019t want to work for an organization that subtly prioritizes its own growth over its stated goals, or that feeds key parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem to the political maw in the United States or elsewhere. So we need the oversight of the Bitcoin community to hold us to account. Risk management and regular, open reassessment is meant to make us and you more aware of the challenges to Bitcoin we see and what we\u2019re doing about them. If, over time, we fail to solve them, you\u2019ll be right to ask why and demand that we do better.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve said above certainly sounds \u201canti-lobbying,\u201d but we won\u2019t decline to use any tool that will help protect Bitcoin. You can expect that we\u2019ll begin to lobby\u2014systematically and intelligently\u2014in the near future, both in Washington, D.C., and in other world capitols.\n\nAnyone in the Bitcoin community is free to petition their governments in pursuit of their goals, of course. My preference would be for you to be as systematic and careful as we are trying to be. I have some experience in the field and obviously have some thoughts to share. If you\u2019re a Bitcoiner with plans or existing programs to work on public policy, by all means let\u2019s compare notes and see how we can work together.

These last few months have been full of some of the most positive news I could imagine; powerhouse investors and large corporations are engaging positively with Bitcoin. They\u2019ve also shown us some very challenging times \u2014 Bitcoiners are seeing real hardship because of the Mt. Gox meltdown.\n\nAs Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, I owe you an apology. Bitcoin has grown more quickly than we have, and we weren\u2019t prepared to keep up.\n\nWhat can we do to improve? I have some ideas, and I would like yours as well. First, we need to continue to staff up our communications team, and change our communications culture. Second, we need a more precisely defined and stronger set of guiding principles. Third, we need to make some small modifications to our Governance structure.\n\nI hope to see you at [Bitcoin2014](http:\/\/bitcoin2014.com\/) in Amsterdam May 15-17. We will have an open conversation with all our members on May 17, 4pm. (edit: Annual Member\u2019s Mtg will take place Sat, May 17 after closing session, approximately 5:30pm)\n\n**Communications**\n\nThe primary operational change we need to make is better, more transparent communication. The entire team at the Foundation is very small; until recently just six full-time employees. We are incredibly lucky to have a huge bevy of volunteers who run our committees and do much of the work, along with the international members pushing forward in individual countries and the amazing advocacy all of our members do naturally.\n\nYou, our members, deserve better communication. We have let two things get in the way; the first is that we\u2019ve had complex, sometimes delicate communications concerns around some of our advocacy work in the United States. We have wanted to respect the process people like Patrick Murck and Jim Harper are engaged in, and give them space out of the public eye to work with regulators and law enforcement.\n\nThe second is that we\u2019ve been lazy and undisciplined about getting updates written in the face of so much possible content. Jon Matonis is tackling this, getting better communications rolling, and staffing up our communications team as a way to add more resources.\n\nI\u2019ve put forward a challenge to the team: \u201cSay a lot more.\u201d There\u2019s much more we can say than we have about what we\u2019re up to, amazing things our members are doing, and what\u2019s happening in the regulatory world. I would like the Foundation to really stretch on this, both because you deserve to see how your bitcoins are being spent, and because we will all benefit from the sort of vigorous debates that I know will ensue.\n\nThey\u2019ve risen to the challenge, and have as a first response opened up read access to our [member forums](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/forum\/) to the public. They are also about to launch a new website on July 1, it is designed to make it easier to get information out about what\u2019s happening around Bitcoin and for our members.\n\n**Values**\n\nPromote, Protect, Standardize leave a lot of room for discussion, and as a mission statement it is noticeably vague as to some core questions that Bitcoiners care about: what about decentralization? What about privacy?\n\nIt\u2019s time to take a stronger stance about what we believe in.\n\n**Freedom to transact economically is a human right.** Bitcoin provides an opportunity to bring this freedom to people around the world.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to the core values that enable this freedom: Decentralization, Fungibility, Standardization and User-controlled privacy.\n\nWe will be soliciting feedback on these at Bitcoin 2014 in Amsterdam, both the values and the reasoning behind them \u2013 let\u2019s see how much consensus we can get as a community around these.\n\n**Decentralization**\n\nCentralization adds so many risks to Bitcoin that we think of it as almost self-evident this needs to be protected. Often debates arise not as to whether the technology should become more centralized, but instead as to whether or not an innovation or concept or business model might increase or decrease centralization.\n\nWe need to keep at this one, and keep it as our first priority; we will continue to gain facility with these new decentralized computational tools over time, and we should keep vigorously debating the impact on centralization as we do.\n\n**Fungibility**\n\nMoney \u2013 cash money \u2013 paper money \u2013 money from governments \u2013 is fungible. You can accept cash as change from a bank or a local butcher shop without worrying about where the cash has been, or if someone else will accept it. In that way, paper currency is largely \u2018memory free\u2019. Not all of our money is memory free \u2013 for instance, credit card payments remember where they came from, and can be summoned back via a chargeback.\n\nBitcoins have a lot of memory. Depending on how they\u2019ve been used, researchers are able to trace owners back many years by inspecting the blockchain. And, of course, there are ways to add metadata to bitcoins to increase the amount of information and memory we have about them.\n\nColored coins, black-listing, red-listing and other proposals all want to add memory to our coins \u2013 often for arguably good or innovative reasons. Most of the proposals can be implemented without any changes to the Bitcoin network as a whole, they could be added as a layer on top of Bitcoin. Some require protocol changes.\n\nWhen we say fungibility is critical for freedom of transaction, we are not saying that any of the above is good or bad, per se. We are instead committing ourselves to the idea that the Bitcoin protocol itself shouldn\u2019t force such systems on users. Bitcoin is best and most valuable if a coin is a coin is a coin. For those who wish to use such systems, they should be allowed to opt in.\n\n**Standardization**\n\nOne Bitcoin weakness is that the core client is the protocol specification. This has two major downsides; it makes it difficult for theoretical cryptographers and computer scientists to add their knowledge to our protocol, and it makes it very hard to implement alternate clients.\n\nAlternate clients, if working, would add significant decentralization to Bitcoin \u2013 if a certain client had a bug or was compromised in some way, the negative impact would be greatly mitigated.\n\nCryptographers can\u2019t (or don\u2019t often wish to) inspect C++ code to assess how the protocol works, and so they can\u2019t be as helpful as they\u2019d like to be. Problems like transaction malleability would be more easily assessable and solutions could be debated and worked on more easily with a specification that allowed collaboration between theorists and engineers.\n\nAs many core developers have pointed out over the years, actually specifying the protocol is extremely hard work, especially while our community continues to innovate.\n\nThis is a place that I feel the Foundation could help directly, by providing funds and motivation for what will undoubtedly be a long slog. The benefit to all of us at the end would be immense, though \u2013 we would have significant risk reduction with a functioning implementable specification.\n\n**User-controlled Privacy**\n\nPrivacy is extremely hard to come by on the Internet. Bitcoin itself is not very private right now.\n\nPublication of the owner of a single Bitcoin address can yield an incredible amount of personal financial information, information that cannot be put \u2018back in the box\u2019 \u2013 it will be available forever, encoded into the blockchain. This is the sort of information that law enforcement agencies would typically need to subpoena a bank for; instead right now we offer it to the entire Internet.\n\nWe haven\u2019t yet seen significant involvement from consumer privacy agencies at the Foundation, but I believe they will be horrified when they understand just how much private financial data is being broadcast and permanently recorded.\n\nThis information directly impacts citizens living under repressive governments. It could cause physical harm to a woman whose finances are controlled by her pimp or her kidnapper. The knowledge of transactions can be combined with violence to limit any human\u2019s fundamental right to transact economically.\n\nIt seems therefore critical that we do everything we can to support efforts that enhance this privacy from global inspection. Technological efforts like trustless sharing and ZeroCoin\/ZeroCash have potential to improve the privacy guarantees available to those using Bitcoin.\n\nNot everyone will want this kind of privacy to be available. In some jurisdictions, concerns over money laundering are brought up as the reason why such privacy should not be available.\n\nI believe that these concerns are real and valid, and pragmatically, that a balance needs to be struck. We don\u2019t yet know exactly how to balance the risks to different parties; on the one hand direct violence, control of individuals and financial risks borne by citizens with hyper-inflationary money supply are real harms being borne by human beings around the world right now. On the other hand there are real and more generalized harms to society that money laundering enables.\n\nRight now, I believe the most reasonable regulatory approach is to encourage anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules that can be implemented at the \u2018endpoints\u2019, Bitcoin exchanges or money transmittal businesses. These businesses already have clear regulation and operations rules and understand how to identify money laundering, and what to do about it when they see it.\n\nAt the same time, we need to do better protecting those who have no other safe way to transact economically, and the Foundation will be providing support for a variety of proposals as a way to let the broader community engage with them and assess what would be useful.\n\n**Governance Tweaks**\n\nOur board election schedule is in major flux right now; we have two seats that need filling. Our original bylaws had all board members come up for election on the same date, making for the possibility of massive turnover every few years.

Expect that soon.\n\n\n","html":"<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s been quite a year, ending with an intense quarter for Bitcoiners. These last few months have been full of some of the most positive news I could imagine; powerhouse investors and large corporations are engaging positively with Bitcoin.  They\u2019ve also shown us some very challenging times &#8212; Bitcoiners are seeing real hardship because of the Mt. Gox meltdown.<\/p>\n<p>As Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation, I owe you an apology. Bitcoin has grown more quickly than we have, and we weren\u2019t prepared to keep up.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What can we do to improve? I have some ideas, and I would like yours as well. First, we need to continue to staff up our communications team, and change our communications culture. Second, we need a more precisely defined and stronger set of guiding principles. Third, we need to make some small modifications to our Governance structure.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I hope to see you at <a href=\"http:\/\/bitcoin2014.com\/\">Bitcoin2014<\/a> in Amsterdam May 15-17. We will have an open conversation with all our members on May 17, 4pm. (edit: Annual Member&#8217;s Mtg will take place Sat, May 17 after closing session, approximately 5:30pm)<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Communications<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary operational change we need to make is better, more transparent communication. The entire team at the Foundation is very small; until recently just six full-time employees. We are incredibly lucky to have a huge bevy of volunteers who run our committees and do much of the work, along with the international members pushing forward in individual countries and the amazing advocacy all of our members do naturally.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You, our members, deserve better communication. We have let two things get in the way; the first is that we\u2019ve had complex, sometimes delicate communications concerns around some of our advocacy work in the United States. We have wanted to respect the process people like Patrick Murck and Jim Harper are engaged in, and give them space out of the public eye to work with regulators and law enforcement.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The second is that we\u2019ve been lazy and undisciplined about getting updates written in the face of so much possible content. Jon Matonis is tackling this, getting better communications rolling, and staffing up our communications team as a way to add more resources.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019ve put forward a challenge to the team: \u201cSay a lot more.\u201d There\u2019s much more we can say than we have about what we\u2019re up to, amazing things our members are doing, and what\u2019s happening in the regulatory world. I would like the Foundation to really stretch on this, both because you deserve to see how your bitcoins are being spent, and because we will all benefit from the sort of vigorous debates that I know will ensue.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019ve risen to the challenge, and have as a first response opened up read access to our <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/forum\/\">member forums<\/a> to the public. They are also about to launch a new website on July 1, it is designed to make it easier to get information out about what\u2019s happening around Bitcoin and for our members.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Values<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Promote, Protect, Standardize leave a lot of room for discussion, and as a mission statement it is noticeably vague as to some core questions that Bitcoiners care about: what about decentralization? What about privacy?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It\u2019s time to take a stronger stance about what we believe in.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Freedom to transact economically is a human right.<\/strong> Bitcoin provides an opportunity to bring this freedom to people around the world.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Foundation is committed to the core values that enable this freedom: Decentralization, Fungibility, Standardization and User-controlled privacy.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will be soliciting feedback on these at Bitcoin 2014 in Amsterdam, both the values and the reasoning behind them \u2013 let\u2019s see how much consensus we can get as a community around these.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Decentralization<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Centralization adds so many risks to Bitcoin that we think of it as almost self-evident this needs to be protected. Often debates arise not as to whether the technology should become more centralized, but instead as to whether or not an innovation or concept or business model might increase or decrease centralization.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We need to keep at this one, and keep it as our first priority; we will continue to gain facility with these new decentralized computational tools over time, and we should keep vigorously debating the impact on centralization as we do.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fungibility<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Money \u2013 cash money \u2013 paper money \u2013 money from governments \u2013 is fungible. You can accept cash as change from a bank or a local butcher shop without worrying about where the cash has been, or if someone else will accept it. In that way, paper currency is largely \u2018memory free\u2019. Not all of our money is memory free \u2013 for instance, credit card payments remember where they came from, and can be summoned back via a chargeback.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoins have a lot of memory. Depending on how they\u2019ve been used, researchers are able to trace owners back many years by inspecting the blockchain. And, of course, there are ways to add metadata to bitcoins to increase the amount of information and memory we have about them.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Colored coins, black-listing, red-listing and other proposals all want to add memory to our coins \u2013 often for arguably good or innovative reasons. Most of the proposals can be implemented without any changes to the Bitcoin network as a whole, they could be added as a layer on top of Bitcoin. Some require protocol changes.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When we say fungibility is critical for freedom of transaction, we are not saying that any of the above is good or bad, per se. We are instead committing ourselves to the idea that the Bitcoin protocol itself shouldn\u2019t force such systems on users. Bitcoin is best and most valuable if a coin is a coin is a coin. For those who wish to use such systems, they should be allowed to opt in.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Standardization<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One Bitcoin weakness is that the core client is the protocol specification. This has two major downsides; it makes it difficult for theoretical cryptographers and computer scientists to add their knowledge to our protocol, and it makes it very hard to implement alternate clients.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alternate clients, if working, would add significant decentralization to Bitcoin \u2013 if a certain client had a bug or was compromised in some way, the negative impact would be greatly mitigated.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cryptographers can\u2019t (or don\u2019t often wish to) inspect C++ code to assess how the protocol works, and so they can\u2019t be as helpful as they\u2019d like to be. Problems like transaction malleability would be more easily assessable and solutions could be debated and worked on more easily with a specification that allowed collaboration between theorists and engineers.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As many core developers have pointed out over the years, actually specifying the protocol is extremely hard work, especially while our community continues to innovate.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a place that I feel the Foundation could help directly, by providing funds and motivation for what will undoubtedly be a long slog. The benefit to all of us at the end would be immense, though \u2013 we would have significant risk reduction with a functioning implementable specification.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>User-controlled Privacy<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Privacy is extremely hard to come by on the Internet. Bitcoin itself is not very private right now.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Publication of the owner of a single Bitcoin address can yield an incredible amount of personal financial information, information that cannot be put \u2018back in the box\u2019 \u2013 it will be available forever, encoded into the blockchain. This is the sort of information that law enforcement agencies would typically need to subpoena a bank for; instead right now we offer it to the entire Internet.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We haven\u2019t yet seen significant involvement from consumer privacy agencies at the Foundation, but I believe they will be horrified when they understand just how much private financial data is being broadcast and permanently recorded.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This information directly impacts citizens living under repressive governments. It could cause physical harm to a woman whose finances are controlled by her pimp or her kidnapper. The knowledge of transactions can be combined with violence to limit any human\u2019s fundamental right to transact economically.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It seems therefore critical that we do everything we can to support efforts that enhance this privacy from global inspection. Technological efforts like trustless sharing and ZeroCoin\/ZeroCash have potential to improve the privacy guarantees available to those using Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not everyone will want this kind of privacy to be available.  In some jurisdictions, concerns over money laundering are brought up as the reason why such privacy should not be available.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I believe that these concerns are real and valid, and pragmatically, that a balance needs to be struck. We don\u2019t yet know exactly how to balance the risks to different parties; on the one hand direct violence, control of individuals and financial risks borne by citizens with hyper-inflationary money supply are real harms being borne by human beings around the world right now. On the other hand there are real and more generalized harms to society that money laundering enables.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Right now, I believe the most reasonable regulatory approach is to encourage anti-money-laundering and know-your-customer rules that can be implemented at the \u2018endpoints\u2019, Bitcoin exchanges or money transmittal businesses. These businesses already have clear regulation and operations rules and understand how to identify money laundering, and what to do about it when they see it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the same time, we need to do better protecting those who have no other safe way to transact economically, and the Foundation will be providing support for a variety of proposals as a way to let the broader community engage with them and assess what would be useful.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Governance Tweaks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our board election schedule is in major flux right now; we have two seats that need filling. Our original bylaws had all board members come up for election on the same date, making for the possibility of massive turnover every few years. This issue shouldn\u2019t be a tough one to get right, we just got it wrong when we started by putting all the seats up for election at the same time. It\u2019s the right time to fix it.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I\u2019d like to take the opportunity afforded by these special elections to get the Foundation on a staggered two-year board term (\u201cEven or Odd years\u201d).

However, she needs our help!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For those of you that may not have heard of her, here&#8217;s a great <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W1EipgGE45s&amp;feature=youtu.be\">clip<\/a> on her and her work in Botswana. I was first introduced to Alah and her story back in January and was utterly amazed and encouraged by the work she is doing to promote Bitcoin adoption and economic freedom throughout Botswana.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Alah has single handedly organized several meet-ups in Botswana and is looking to work with businesses in Botswana to start accepting Bitcoin. Additionally, she has been a tireless evangelist on educating people in her community on the merits of Bitcoin. As a game changer in the Bitcoin community, we ask for your help in providing the opportunity for her to travel to Bitcoin 2014. Global financial inclusion is one of the most beneficial social and economic outcomes of Bitcoin&#8217;s worldwide adoption. Her presence and participation at <a href=\"http:\/\/bitcoin2014.com\">#Bitcoin2014<\/a> will empower her to keep growing the Bitcoin ecosystem in Africa.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Will you help us get Alah to <a href=\"http:\/\/bitcoin2014.com\">#Bitcoin2014<\/a> and connected to our community?<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Please feel free to donate as led. We will need to raise approx. US$4,000 (in BTC) by April 16th to be able to cover her airfare, visa fee, hotel, and meals.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Donations can be made to:<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blockchain.info\/address\/18XkPm3cm1mjbb19NEdvLZq7XyPQJcLUZG\">18XkPm3cm1mjbb19NEdvLZq7XyPQJcLUZG<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you to Roger Ver for setting up and volunteering to monitor this wallet!<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam!<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sincerely,<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elizabeth T.

Tell your mother about it.\n\nThat\u2019s the upshot of [survey results released earlier this week](http:\/\/reason.com\/poll\/2014\/04\/07\/millennials-the-tech-savvy-independents). The Reason-Rupe poll [shared data](http:\/\/reason.com\/poll\/2014\/04\/01\/april-2014-poll#bitcoin) about a recent (U.S. national) survey that included questions about Bitcoin. Their findings comport with what you might expect: There\u2019s a nice, neat correlation between awareness of Bitcoin and appreciation of Bitcoin. Most people don\u2019t know about Bitcoin, though, and people who don\u2019t know about Bitcoin are the most inclined to \u201cban\u201d it.\n\nBitcoin can\u2019t be banned, of course. It\u2019s an open-source communications protocol that people the world over are going to be fairly insistent on using. But take the impulse to \u201cban\u201d as a willingness to see Bitcoin hemmed in various ways. It\u2019s a willingness politicians and regulators will indulge if they see advantage in doing so.\n\nPolitician and regulator perception of public opinion is a key input into their behavior. Professional politicians and lifelong regulators are skilled surfers of public opinion. Their initiatives and priorities are guided by what they see in the water ahead of them. (Yes, they want to do the right thing, but public approval is their key to power, so they\u2019ll prioritize attention and acclaim over right answers.) If they see rocks of disapproval under the surface in one direction, they will lean away and head for the glassy waters of public acclaim in the other.\n\nThat is why the thinking of ordinary people is key to Bitcoin\u2019s protection in the public policy area. We need more people to know about Bitcoin and thus to approve of Bitcoin. The Reason-Rupe poll shows that the deficit in awareness and approval is among older people and, to a lesser degree, among women. The sooner older women know and like Bitcoin, the sooner Bitcoin will be safe from badly thought-out government policies. Getting people to know about Bitcoin will also help with adoption, of course.\n\nSo here are some things we need you to do: First, share this blog post with friends and colleagues in the Bitcoin community. Second, tell your mother about Bitcoin. It doesn\u2019t have to literally be your mother, of course, but any older woman you know. If you can\u2019t find one of those, tell an older man. Help them get set up with a Bitcoin wallet. Give them a little starter Bitcoin to carry around and have fun with. Get them set up on an exchange or other service where they can acquire more Bitcoin of their own.\n\nBitcoin is a lot of things. Among them, it\u2019s a meme. And memes pass from person to person. So pass along the Bitcoin meme today. The place to start is by telling your mother.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Want to help promote and protect Bitcoin?

That panel was a terrific review of events over the past year and the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s role in protecting our favorite protocol. It\u2019s easy to forget the uncertainty that Bitcoin faced a year ago. It was well within the realm of possibility that the U.S. government and governments around the world would cast Bitcoin as a tool of illegality, and agency after agency would make moves against Bitcoin and its users. ([Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YMqrrDJ.jpg), but the pace at which it\u2019s adopted sure does.)\n\nBitcoin Foundation General Counsel Patrick Murck and Marco Santori, Brian Klein, and Mike Hearn (each of the latter three a foundation committee chair) described their interactions and work on issues with the U.S. Treasury Department\u2014both FinCEN and IRS, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. Federal Election Commission, state regulators in New York and California (as well as their umbrella group, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and also <span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">amicus<\/span> work the foundation is preparing with respect to state-level law enforcement. Their work and the work of many others has produced a very different tone than what loomed a year ago: As governments integrate Bitcoin into their regulatory systems, they will seek the benefits of Bitcoin while mitigating the risks.\n\nGovernments won\u2019t always get it right\u2014in fact, they\u2019ll sometimes get it quite wrong\u2014so I was delighted by the presentation of [Rainey Reitman of EFF](https:\/\/www.eff.org\/about\/staff\/rainey-reitman) and [Marcia Hoffman](http:\/\/marciahofmann.com\/) (of many august affiliations) on countering financial censorship. As I\u2019d hoped, they shared some of their experience in the fight against SOPA and how that might apply in the Bitcoin world. They also brought their expertise to another panel I moderated, \u201cPerspectives on Government Relations.\u201d Activist Reitman and civil liberties lawyer Hoffman joined defense counsel Brian Klein and lobbyist [Mary Beth Stanton](http:\/\/www.heatherpodesta.com\/team\/mary-beth-stanton\/) to illustrate all the ways that the Bitcoin community can pursue its interests in the public policy world. Bitcoiners from a number of countries joined in the Q&A to share their experiences and offer their ideas. Video of the panels should be available soon.\n\nMy own presentation on managing risks to the Bitcoin ecosystem was well attended and received. It was a recap of the \u201c[Removing Impediments to Bitcoin\u2019s Success](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/static\/2014\/04\/Bitcoin-Risk-Management-Study-Spring-2014.pdf)\u201d study released and [discussed here on the blog](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/04\/02\/removing-impediments-to-bitcoins-success-and-your-role-in-holding-us-to-account-2\/) in early April. This kind of study is intended to bring focus to my work, the work of the foundation, and the work of the Bitcoin community. Patrick Murck and I discussed the foundation\u2019s anticipated policy efforts in a fireside chat emceed by Bloomberg reporter Carter Dougherty. There were many more valuable presentations and panels, of course.\n\nTogether, all of them showcase a significant body of work on the part of the foundation and the Bitcoin community on law and policy issues worldwide. There is no call for triumphalism, but things are going in the right direction\u2014especially compared to what could have been.\n\nHaving stopped over for a Bitcoin-related visit to Brussels Monday, though, I arrived in the U.S. yesterday to read this headline:\n\n\u201c**Bitcoin Investor Bemoans \u2018Terrible\u2019 Lobbying Effort**.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s terrible,\u2019 he said, of the bitcoin community\u2019s efforts to work with regulators and lawmakers.\u201d That\u2019s Marc Andreessen speaking to POLITICO Pro ([paywall](https:\/\/www.politicopro.com\/go\/?id=34120)).\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s this thing called the Bitcoin Foundation,\u201d Andreessen said, \u201cbut in a sense it\u2019s kind of superfluous because it could go away tomorrow and bitcoin would still be there.\u201d\n\nAndreessen\u2019s words stand in some contrast to my sense of things. As an observer impressed enough by the foundation\u2019s work to join its ranks in March, I\u2019m not the best judge of of the Bitcoin Foundation. So I encourage you to render your own judgment. Is the Bitcoin Foundation a superfluous contributor to public policy \u201cdisaster\u201d? Or is it something a little better than that? (I\u2019ll post this in the forum for member reaction.)\n\nA meta issue is just as interesting: I\u2019ve been in Washington, D.C. almost as long as Andreessen has been in Silicon Valley, and I\u2019ve been a student of government and politics much longer. But I must confess that I missed where Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Ronald Reagan, or Bill Clinton said that it\u2019s a good idea to dis your allies in the press. I sometimes have disagreements with colleagues, and right now we are working to mop things up after some Bitcoiners\u2019 imprudence created some problems for our community. But do you see how I\u2019m not airing it in public? I wonder who did Andreessen\u2019s advance work and who helped him put together the talking points that resulted in these quotes.\n\nIt\u2019s stating the obvious to say that Marc Andreessen is an incredible asset to the Bitcoin ecosystem and community, and that his technical foresight and business leadership are invaluable contributions. I hope he\u2019ll come discuss his distinctive public policy strategy and tactics at #Bitcoin2015!\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"color: #676766;\">#Bitcoin2014 was an exhilarating three days, and the <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/05\/20\/willkommen-germany-welkom-netherlands\/\">addition of Germany and the Netherlands<\/a> to the Bitcoin Foundation affiliate roster was a nice feather in the cap of an event that saw over 1,000 attendees from 50 countries around the world.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">As you might guess, I spent the bulk of my non-networking time at sessions in the law and policy track, including as moderator of the \u201cBitcoin Foundation Law and Policy Year in Review\u201d panel.

(<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YMqrrDJ.jpg\">Bitcoin doesn\u2019t care<\/a>, but the pace at which it\u2019s adopted sure does.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Bitcoin Foundation General Counsel Patrick Murck and Marco Santori, Brian Klein, and Mike Hearn (each of the latter three a foundation committee chair) described their interactions and work on issues with the U.S. Treasury Department\u2014both FinCEN and IRS, the U.S. Senate, the U.S. Federal Election Commission, state regulators in New York and California (as well as their umbrella group, the Conference of State Bank Supervisors), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and also <span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">amicus<\/span> work the foundation is preparing with respect to state-level law enforcement. Their work and the work of many others has produced a very different tone than what loomed a year ago: As governments integrate Bitcoin into their regulatory systems, they will seek the benefits of Bitcoin while mitigating the risks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Governments won\u2019t always get it right\u2014in fact, they\u2019ll sometimes get it quite wrong\u2014so I was delighted by the presentation of <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.eff.org\/about\/staff\/rainey-reitman\">Rainey Reitman of EFF<\/a> and <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"http:\/\/marciahofmann.com\/\">Marcia Hoffman<\/a> (of many august affiliations) on countering financial censorship. As I\u2019d hoped, they shared some of their experience in the fight against SOPA and how that might apply in the Bitcoin world. They also brought their expertise to another panel I moderated, \u201cPerspectives on Government Relations.\u201d Activist Reitman and civil liberties lawyer Hoffman joined defense counsel Brian Klein and lobbyist <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.heatherpodesta.com\/team\/mary-beth-stanton\/\">Mary Beth Stanton<\/a> to illustrate all the ways that the Bitcoin community can pursue its interests in the public policy world. Bitcoiners from a number of countries joined in the Q&amp;A to share their experiences and offer their ideas. Video of the panels should be available soon.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">My own presentation on managing risks to the Bitcoin ecosystem was well attended and received. It was a recap of the \u201c<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/static\/2014\/04\/Bitcoin-Risk-Management-Study-Spring-2014.pdf\">Removing Impediments to Bitcoin\u2019s Success<\/a>\u201d study released and <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/04\/02\/removing-impediments-to-bitcoins-success-and-your-role-in-holding-us-to-account-2\/\">discussed here on the blog<\/a> in early April. This kind of study is intended to bring focus to my work, the work of the foundation, and the work of the Bitcoin community. Patrick Murck and I discussed the foundation\u2019s anticipated policy efforts in a fireside chat emceed by Bloomberg reporter Carter Dougherty. There were many more valuable presentations and panels, of course.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Together, all of them showcase a significant body of work on the part of the foundation and the Bitcoin community on law and policy issues worldwide. There is no call for triumphalism, but things are going in the right direction\u2014especially compared to what could have been.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Having stopped over for a Bitcoin-related visit to Brussels Monday, though, I arrived in the U.S. yesterday to read this headline:<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">\u201c<strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Bitcoin Investor Bemoans \u2018Terrible\u2019 Lobbying Effort<\/strong>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">\u201c\u2018It\u2019s a disaster. It\u2019s terrible,\u2019 he said, of the bitcoin community\u2019s efforts to work with regulators and lawmakers.\u201d That\u2019s Marc Andreessen speaking to POLITICO Pro (<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.politicopro.com\/go\/?id=34120\">paywall<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">\u201cSo there\u2019s this thing called the Bitcoin Foundation,\u201d Andreessen said, \u201cbut in a sense it\u2019s kind of superfluous because it could go away tomorrow and bitcoin would still be there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Andreessen\u2019s words stand in some contrast to my sense of things. As an observer impressed enough by the foundation\u2019s work to join its ranks in March, I\u2019m not the best judge of of the Bitcoin Foundation. So I encourage you to render your own judgment. Is the Bitcoin Foundation a superfluous contributor to public policy \u201cdisaster\u201d? Or is it something a little better than that? (I\u2019ll post this in the forum for member reaction.)<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">A meta issue is just as interesting: I\u2019ve been in Washington, D.C. almost as long as Andreessen has been in Silicon Valley, and I\u2019ve been a student of government and politics much longer. But I must confess that I missed where Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Ronald Reagan, or Bill Clinton said that it\u2019s a good idea to dis your allies in the press. I sometimes have disagreements with colleagues, and right now we are working to mop things up after some Bitcoiners\u2019 imprudence created some problems for our community. But do you see how I\u2019m not airing it in public? I wonder who did Andreessen\u2019s advance work and who helped him put together the talking points that resulted in these quotes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">It\u2019s stating the obvious to say that Marc Andreessen is an incredible asset to the Bitcoin ecosystem and community, and that his technical foresight and business leadership are invaluable contributions. I hope he\u2019ll come discuss his distinctive public policy strategy and tactics at #Bitcoin2015!<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":4,"created_at":"Wed, 21 May 2014 20:37:50 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Wed, 02 Jul 2014 16:01:36 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Wed, 21 May 2014 20:37:50 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":248,"title":"#TBT #Bitcoin2014 Recap","slug":"tbt-bitcoin2014-recap","markdown":"\n[  \n![Bitcoin 2014 friday afternoon evening_MG_5064 copy](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/static\/2014\/05\/Bitcoin-2014-friday-afternoon-evening_MG_5064-copy-1024x682.jpg)](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/static\/2014\/05\/Bitcoin-2014-friday-afternoon-evening_MG_5064-copy.jpg)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that just one week ago, we were in the Netherlands together for #Bitcoin2014!

As used herein this Section 5.15, a \u201cconflict of interest transaction\u201d is a transaction with the Corporation in which a director of the Corporation has a direct or indirect interest. An indirect interest exists where: (i) another entity in which the director has a material interest, or in which the director is a general partner, is a party to the transaction; or (ii) if another entity of which the director is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors.\n\n(b) Approval. A conflict of interest transaction is not always voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director. The transaction is not voidable or the basis for director liability if it is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into, or is approved either: (i) in advance by a vote of the Board of Directors, or a Board of Directors committee, and the material facts of the transaction and the director\u2019s interest were disclosed or known to the Board or committee; or (ii) if the material facts of the transaction and the director\u2019s interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction. Such authorization, approval, or ratification of a conflict of interest transaction can occur as follows:\n\n(i) By Directors. By the Board of Directors, if the conflict of interest transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the Board or committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. However, a conflict of interest transaction may not be so authorized, approved, or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors with no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification, if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted by law.\n\n(ii) By Members. By the members of the Corporation if the conflict of interest transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction may be counted in such a vote to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking such action.\n\nSection 5.16 Resignation and Removal:\n\n(a) Resignation.

Only the Board of Directors may vote to remove such director by a majority vote of the remaining directors.\n\n(c) Removal Without Cause. Any director may be removed without cause at a meeting called for that purpose by the Board of Directors.

As used herein this Section 5.15, a &#8220;conflict of interest transaction&#8221; is a transaction with the Corporation in which a director of the Corporation has a direct or indirect interest. An indirect interest exists where: (i) another entity in which the director has a material interest, or in which the director is a general partner, is a party to the transaction; or (ii) if another entity of which the director is a director, officer, or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Corporation&#8217;s Board of Directors.<\/p>\n<p>(b) Approval. A conflict of interest transaction is not always voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the director. The transaction is not voidable or the basis for director liability if it is fair to the corporation at the time it was entered into, or is approved either: (i) in advance by a vote of the Board of Directors, or a Board of Directors committee, and the material facts of the transaction and the director&#8217;s interest were disclosed or known to the Board or committee; or (ii) if the material facts of the transaction and the director&#8217;s interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved, or ratified the transaction. Such authorization, approval, or ratification of a conflict of interest transaction can occur as follows:<\/p>\n<p>(i) By Directors. By the Board of Directors, if the conflict of interest transaction receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors on the Board or committee who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction. However, a conflict of interest transaction may not be so authorized, approved, or ratified by a single director. If a majority of the directors with no direct or indirect interest in the transaction votes to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking such action. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification, if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted by law.<\/p>\n<p>(ii) By Members. By the members of the Corporation if the conflict of interest transaction receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted. Votes cast by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction may be counted in such a vote to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. A majority of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking such action.<\/p>\n<p>Section 5.16 Resignation and Removal:<\/p>\n<p>(a) Resignation. A director may resign at any time by giving written notice to: (i) the Board of Directors; (ii) the Chairman of the Board; or (iii) the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation is effective when notice is effective. Notice of resignation is irrevocable once delivered, unless the Board of Directors permits withdrawal prior to its effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>(b) Removal for Cause. The Board of Directors may remove any director elected by the members for cause at a meeting called for that purpose, if the director has been: (i) declared of unsound mind by a final order of court; (ii) convicted of a felony; or (iii) found by a final order or judgment to have breached any duty arising under these Bylaws, the Articles, or applicable law. Only the Board of Directors may vote to remove such director by a majority vote of the remaining directors.<\/p>\n<p>(c) Removal Without Cause. Any director may be removed without cause at a meeting called for that purpose by the Board of Directors. The director may be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the directors then in office.<\/p>\n<p>Section 5.17 Advisory Board: The Board of Directors may, by resolution, establish a board of advisors (the &#8220;Advisory Board&#8221;) to be comprised of one or more individuals chosen by the Board of Directors at its sole discretion.

In light of GHash.IO\u2019s decision to do nothing, many suggestions have been made for possible solutions. This blog post will review some and outline what can be done to help rectify the situation.\n\nFirstly let\u2019s put aside solutions that don\u2019t address the problem, or that would make things worse. Many alt coins identify \u201cASIC resistance\u201d as a design goal. It\u2019s tempting to think about rewinding the clock by changing the proof of work algorithm. But this is fraught with difficulty. Firstly, there\u2019s really [no such thing as an ASIC-resistant algorithm.](https:\/\/download.wpsoftware.net\/bitcoin\/asic-faq.pdf)Almost by definition, the only way to force someone to use a CPU instead of an ASIC is to use \u201crun an arbitrary computer program\u201d as your proof of work, otherwise, you are doing a specific task and an application specific integrated circuit can always have the advantage. But nobody knows how to design a Bitcoin-like system which requires execution of arbitrarily complex and ever changing programs as the proof of work. Secondly, before the ASIC era Bitcoin had to tackle a different kind of problematic miner: botnets. Several botnets stole electricity to mine coins, which had nasty side effects. For instance, at least one of them mined only empty blocks, which is worse than the situation we have now. Losing ASICs would bring them back. Thirdly, invalidating the huge investment in ASIC farms already made would have profound consequences for the future of the project and people\u2019s willingness to mine in future.\n\nSo if changing the proof of work algorithm is not a solution, what is?\n\nWe don\u2019t know for sure, but we can identify useful tasks that help us move towards a more decentralised future. None of them are silver bullets, but most of them are quite easy: they\u2019re what developers call [low hanging fruit.](http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=low-hanging+fruit) By working together and picking enough of this fruit, we might be able to tip the balance in favour of decentralised mining. To save keystrokes, from now on I\u2019m going to call this freemining.\n\n**Freeminers, unite!**\n\nLet\u2019s define what this word means. It does not mean no pooling. The problem we face with mining is not pooling to reduce payout variance, it\u2019s that in the process of doing so miners give up their ability to select their own block contents. The purpose of mining is to create blocks, thus answering the question of what happened first. When miners give up control of the blocks they mine en-masse, double spending becomes possible, as does going back into the past and maliciously rewriting the block chain. It\u2019s effectively a form of selling your vote.\n\nThere are two ways to do pooled freemining. The problem is, both routes are riddled with potholes and speed bumps that cause many miners to not bother.\n\n1. You can use [p2pool](http:\/\/p2pool.in\/), a peer to peer decentralised mining pool  \n 2. You could (in future) use the getblocktemplate protocol with a regular pool that supports it\n\nFreeminers mine in such a way that they both reduce their payout variance but also create their own blocks, a process that always requires running a fully validating p2p node like [Bitcoin Core.](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/download) To repeat: freemining inherently requires running a full node, and today that means Core. If you aren\u2019t running one, you aren\u2019t decentralising the mining process. This requirement puts people off and later I\u2019ll discuss ways we can make it less painful.\n\n**p2pool\u2019in**\n\nP2Pool is the best solution currently available. But it faces numerous small yet resolvable problems. Smart volunteers could tackle any of them:\n\n**1. Problem: installation is too difficult**\n\nInstallation on Windows is possible via a one click installer, but on Linux and MacOS X no such easy setup exists. P2Pool is a Python program and some miners get stuck in dependency hell trying to simply install it.\n\n**Solution:** One click installers need to be developed for both Linux and OS X. Distro-specific packages on Linux are not always sufficient, as they can fall behind upstream or be unavailable for the users specific distribution. Ideally p2pool would have a selection of packages well maintained by the project, and also a generic Linux installer or tarball usable by everyone else.\n\n**2. Problem: the p2pool website is hard to find**\n\nConfusingly the P2Pool website is at [p2pool.in](http:\/\/p2pool.in\/) as p2pool.org was already taken. The .org page dominates the real p2pool.in website on Google. Worse, the website at p2pool.org is merely a proxy to P2pool that encourages people to mine on it without actually running a full node, and charges a 2% fee in the process. Remember, if you aren\u2019t running Core, you are not freemining. This website confuses people into mining in such a way that they think they\u2019re helping decentralise the network, but are not.\n\n**Solution:** The bitcoin.org website needs a slick, simple miners introduction that links to the right website, explains how to use p2pool properly, and shows miners how to get started. Major bitcoin related websites could link to p2pool.in to try and boost the PageRank of the real site. The owner of p2pool.org could be contacted or bought out to try and fix the flow of miners who are getting misdirected.\n\n**3. Problem: P2Pool feels clunky compared to centralised pools**\n\nOne reason for the popularity of GHash.IO is it presents nice, professionally designed stats pages and monitoring. P2Pool has nice frontends available too, but they aren\u2019t bundled so don\u2019t give users the same slick experience.\n\n**Solution:** the best of the existing p2pool frontends needs to be located and bundled out of the box.\n\n**4. Problem: P2Pool has an increasingly high share difficulty**\n\nP2Pool is a single pool and because of how it works, the more people who mine on it the harder it becomes to find a share. This can be discouraging.\n\n**Solution:** P2Pool could split itself into multiple independent p2pools, amoeba style, whenever it gets too large for small miners to benefit.\n\nP2Pool has other problems too: it can use a lot of memory and bandwidth, and it needs more miners committing to it for the long haul to reduce the variance. But the above issues are the lowest hanging fruit for improving it.\n\n**getblocktemplate**\n\nThe [getblocktemplate](https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Getblocktemplate) protocol allows miners to mine at a client-server pool but without losing control over the blocks that they are mining. It represents a useful middle ground between the pure decentralisation of p2pool and the centralisation of traditional pools. A GBT pool calculates the coinbase transaction that contains payouts in a centralised manner, and then lets the miner select the rest of the block. Quoting Gregory Maxwell,\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit;\">\u201cEffectively p2pool is getblocktemplate plus a distributed system to compute acceptable coinbase transactions\u201d<\/span>\n\nBut there\u2019s a problem: although the protocol theoretically allows for miner-side block creation, the actual software implementations of it don\u2019t do so yet. Nobody has implemented support for freemining with GBT, so pools that support GBT today still do the block creation themselves. This in turn means that with only minor real advantages over its main competitor (Stratum, which doesn\u2019t allow freemining), some pools and mining tools don\u2019t support it.\n\nWe need volunteers to step up and help make getblocktemplate a competitive solution:\n\n1. The software that implements the getblocktemplate protocol needs to be upgraded and finished off, so miners can connect their own copy of Bitcoin Core to the tools and select their own blocks. Fortunately [libblkmaker](https:\/\/gitorious.org\/bitcoin\/libblkmaker\/) (the reference GBT implementation) is designed with support for this in mind, so it should not require any major refactorings or other surgery to enable. If you\u2019re serious about this, please contact Luke Dashjr (\u201cLuke-Jr\u201d on IRC).\n\n2. Mining tools and ASIC systems that don\u2019t natively support GBT can be bridged using a local Stratum-to-GBT proxy, but this is one more system that has to be set up. Ideally this wouldn\u2019t be necessary, or if it must be so, then the proxy should be bundled as well so there\u2019s no setup cost.\n\n3. Tutorials and websites need to be created to teach miners how to configure this: ideally, with everything bundled \u201cout of the box\u201d so setting it up can be a one click process after selecting a GBT supporting pool.\n\n4. More pools need to be lobbied to support GBT once it\u2019s a suitable solution for freemining. This would reduce the pool\u2019s role to that of tracking share submissions and calculating payouts, but they would have no real power over what blocks are mined.\n\n**Making Bitcoin Core less hardcore**\n\nWhat all the above solutions have in common is that you **must** run a full node implementation, which should be Bitcoin Core today. You can\u2019t claim to be a decentralised miner if you don\u2019t, because otherwise you aren\u2019t validating blocks and thus have to follow the instructions of someone else who has.\n\nThousands of volunteers around the world run Core for free: node operators, we love you! But we also hear your pain. Core combines many tasks into one: it processes and validates transactions, but it also serves the block chain to newcomers who don\u2019t have it yet. This latter process can consume large amounts of upstream bandwidth, which is often a limited resource.\n\nIn the short term, miners can stop their bandwidth being used for block chain uploads by blocking inbound connections on port 8333 or using the -nolisten flag. The next version will have a checkbox in the GUI for it. But that means the node won\u2019t contribute to the p2p network at all. A long-term wish of the Core development team has been to teach the software how to use resources more effectively, so making Bitcoin less costly to run. As an example nodes could advertise that they can serve only parts of the block chain instead of all of it. This would allow people to give Core as much bandwidth and disk space as they want to.\n\nThis is an advanced project that requires work on the guts of Bitcoin Core and the peer-to-peer protocol. The existing developers all have their hands full with other tasks, so we\u2019re looking for someone to step up and prototype. It means extending the IP address broadcasting mechanism so nodes can advertise how much of the chain they\u2019re willing to serve, teaching the software how to find them, and then allowing users to tune things so they can reduce their bandwidth usage to levels they can tolerate. This should make it much less painful to run a full node at home, or in other places where upstream bandwidth is constrained.\n\nFor developers who want to get their feet wet, there\u2019s an easier piece of low hanging fruit. Some jerk [thought it would be funny to put virus signatures into the block chain](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/issues\/4069), and now on Windows a few anti-virus scanners are corrupting Bitcoin Core\u2019s database files. A simple fix is to store data obfuscated with a per-machine key so it\u2019s no longer possible to put particular byte sequences into the database on disk. This would help freeminers who use Windows.\n\n**Building a community**\n\nThere\u2019s one last way pools like GHash.io build loyalty amongst their userbase: humans are tribal and we love to join a team. GHash\/CEX run [wallpaper contests](http:\/\/blog.cex.io\/cex-io-wallpaper-10\/) and other things to help build their brand. We need a community of people who feel passionately about freemining, and help other people to get started. T-Shirt designers, this means you! But also we need forums and support networks to help people navigate the issues: no matter how easy we make the path, having someone walk it with you will always be better.\n\n\n","html":"<p style=\"color: #676766;\">In recent days the Bitcoin community has engaged in vigorous debate about how to solve the problem of a small number of players, and GHash.IO specifically, dominating the network\u2019s hash rate. In light of GHash.IO\u2019s decision to do nothing, many suggestions have been made for possible solutions. This blog post will review some and outline what can be done to help rectify the situation.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Firstly let\u2019s put aside solutions that don\u2019t address the problem, or that would make things worse. Many alt coins identify \u201cASIC resistance\u201d as a design goal. It\u2019s tempting to think about rewinding the clock by changing the proof of work algorithm. But this is fraught with difficulty. Firstly, there\u2019s really <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/download.wpsoftware.net\/bitcoin\/asic-faq.pdf\">no such thing as an ASIC-resistant algorithm.<\/a>Almost by definition, the only way to force someone to use a CPU instead of an ASIC is to use \u201crun an arbitrary computer program\u201d as your proof of work, otherwise, you are doing a specific task and an application specific integrated circuit can always have the advantage. But nobody knows how to design a Bitcoin-like system which requires execution of arbitrarily complex and ever changing programs as the proof of work. Secondly, before the ASIC era Bitcoin had to tackle a different kind of problematic miner: botnets. Several botnets stole electricity to mine coins, which had nasty side effects. For instance, at least one of them mined only empty blocks, which is worse than the situation we have now. Losing ASICs would bring them back. Thirdly, invalidating the huge investment in ASIC farms already made would have profound consequences for the future of the project and people\u2019s willingness to mine in future.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">So if changing the proof of work algorithm is not a solution, what is?<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">We don\u2019t know for sure, but we can identify useful tasks that help us move towards a more decentralised future. None of them are silver bullets, but most of them are quite easy: they\u2019re what developers call <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=low-hanging+fruit\">low hanging fruit.<\/a> By working together and picking enough of this fruit, we might be able to tip the balance in favour of decentralised mining. To save keystrokes, from now on I\u2019m going to call this freemining.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Freeminers, unite!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Let\u2019s define what this word means. It does not mean no pooling. The problem we face with mining is not pooling to reduce payout variance, it\u2019s that in the process of doing so miners give up their ability to select their own block contents. The purpose of mining is to create blocks, thus answering the question of what happened first. When miners give up control of the blocks they mine en-masse, double spending becomes possible, as does going back into the past and maliciously rewriting the block chain. It\u2019s effectively a form of selling your vote.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">There are two ways to do pooled freemining. The problem is, both routes are riddled with potholes and speed bumps that cause many miners to not bother.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">1. You can use <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"http:\/\/p2pool.in\/\">p2pool<\/a>, a peer to peer decentralised mining pool<br \/>\n2. You could (in future) use the getblocktemplate protocol with a regular pool that supports it<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Freeminers mine in such a way that they both reduce their payout variance but also create their own blocks, a process that always requires running a fully validating p2p node like <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/download\">Bitcoin Core.<\/a> To repeat: freemining inherently requires running a full node, and today that means Core. If you aren\u2019t running one, you aren\u2019t decentralising the mining process. This requirement puts people off and later I\u2019ll discuss ways we can make it less painful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">p2pool\u2019in<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">P2Pool is the best solution currently available. But it faces numerous small yet resolvable problems. Smart volunteers could tackle any of them:<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">1. Problem: installation is too difficult<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Installation on Windows is possible via a one click installer, but on Linux and MacOS X no such easy setup exists. P2Pool is a Python program and some miners get stuck in dependency hell trying to simply install it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Solution:<\/strong> One click installers need to be developed for both Linux and OS X. Distro-specific packages on Linux are not always sufficient, as they can fall behind upstream or be unavailable for the users specific distribution. Ideally p2pool would have a selection of packages well maintained by the project, and also a generic Linux installer or tarball usable by everyone else.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">2. Problem: the p2pool website is hard to find<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Confusingly the P2Pool website is at <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"http:\/\/p2pool.in\/\">p2pool.in<\/a> as p2pool.org was already taken. The .org page dominates the real p2pool.in website on Google. Worse, the website at p2pool.org is merely a proxy to P2pool that encourages people to mine on it without actually running a full node, and charges a 2% fee in the process. Remember, if you aren\u2019t running Core, you are not freemining. This website confuses people into mining in such a way that they think they\u2019re helping decentralise the network, but are not.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Solution:<\/strong> The bitcoin.org website needs a slick, simple miners introduction that links to the right website, explains how to use p2pool properly, and shows miners how to get started. Major bitcoin related websites could link to p2pool.in to try and boost the PageRank of the real site. The owner of p2pool.org could be contacted or bought out to try and fix the flow of miners who are getting misdirected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">3. Problem: P2Pool feels clunky compared to centralised pools<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">One reason for the popularity of GHash.IO is it presents nice, professionally designed stats pages and monitoring. P2Pool has nice frontends available too, but they aren\u2019t bundled so don\u2019t give users the same slick experience.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Solution:<\/strong> the best of the existing p2pool frontends needs to be located and bundled out of the box.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">4. Problem: P2Pool has an increasingly high share difficulty<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">P2Pool is a single pool and because of how it works, the more people who mine on it the harder it becomes to find a share. This can be discouraging.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">Solution:<\/strong> P2Pool could split itself into multiple independent p2pools, amoeba style, whenever it gets too large for small miners to benefit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">P2Pool has other problems too: it can use a lot of memory and bandwidth, and it needs more miners committing to it for the long haul to reduce the variance. But the above issues are the lowest hanging fruit for improving it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\"><strong style=\"font-style: inherit;\">getblocktemplate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">The <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Getblocktemplate\">getblocktemplate<\/a> protocol allows miners to mine at a client-server pool but without losing control over the blocks that they are mining. It represents a useful middle ground between the pure decentralisation of p2pool and the centralisation of traditional pools. A GBT pool calculates the coinbase transaction that contains payouts in a centralised manner, and then lets the miner select the rest of the block.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s not what the EBA\u2019s report does. Instead, the report recommends that EU regulators \u201cdiscourage credit institutions, payment institutions, and e-money institutions from buying, holding or selling VCs.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not mitigation, which would seek the benefits of digital currency while controlling the costs. The report and[accompanying press release](https:\/\/www.eba.europa.eu\/-\/eba-proposes-potential-regulatory-regime-for-virtual-currencies-but-also-advises-that-financial-institutions-should-not-buy-hold-or-sell-them-whilst-n) emphasize stopping the integration of digital currency into Europe\u2019s financial services system. If that approach were adopted, it would come at a significant cost to the people of Europe, who would wait even longer to enjoy the benefits of digital currencies like Bitcoin.\n\nIt is certainly welcome that the report attempts the rigor of risk management. I\u2019m a big fan of [organized thinking about complex problems](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/04\/02\/removing-impediments-to-bitcoins-success-and-your-role-in-holding-us-to-account-2\/). The digital currency space poses some new risks to consumers and merchants, of course, along with a small variety of other interests. The anonymous author or authors of this report do not reveal how they identified risks.\n\nThe more serious weaknesses of the report\u2019s methodology, though, is its blunt ranking of risks as simply \u201clow\u201d; \u201cmedium\u201d; or \u201chigh.\u201d We don\u2019t know what factors cause a risk to be ranked \u201chigh,\u201d and some 40% of the risks are so ranked. That prevents effective prioritization of risks, and it makes it appear as though there is \u201ctoo much to be done.\u201d This bluntness leads to the conclusion that mainstream integration of digital currency in Europe should stop while regulators produce a new regulatory scheme.\n\nThe better approach, which would have emerged from more granular risk assessment, is to examine how risks that may exist in the digital currency world are already mitigated in the traditional financial world. Capital requirements, for example\u2014an issue discussed in the report\u2014should be applied identically to providers of identical financial services, whether in traditional or digital form.\n\nDigital currencies like Bitcoin are generally new media for performing existing financial functions.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s not what the EBA\u2019s report does. Instead, the report recommends that EU regulators \u201cdiscourage credit institutions, payment institutions, and e-money institutions from buying, holding or selling VCs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">That\u2019s not mitigation, which would seek the benefits of digital currency while controlling the costs. The report and<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.eba.europa.eu\/-\/eba-proposes-potential-regulatory-regime-for-virtual-currencies-but-also-advises-that-financial-institutions-should-not-buy-hold-or-sell-them-whilst-n\">accompanying press release<\/a> emphasize stopping the integration of digital currency into Europe\u2019s financial services system. If that approach were adopted, it would come at a significant cost to the people of Europe, who would wait even longer to enjoy the benefits of digital currencies like Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">It is certainly welcome that the report attempts the rigor of risk management. I\u2019m a big fan of <a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/04\/02\/removing-impediments-to-bitcoins-success-and-your-role-in-holding-us-to-account-2\/\">organized thinking about complex problems<\/a>. The digital currency space poses some new risks to consumers and merchants, of course, along with a small variety of other interests. The anonymous author or authors of this report do not reveal how they identified risks.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">The more serious weaknesses of the report\u2019s methodology, though, is its blunt ranking of risks as simply \u201clow\u201d; \u201cmedium\u201d; or \u201chigh.\u201d We don\u2019t know what factors cause a risk to be ranked \u201chigh,\u201d and some 40% of the risks are so ranked. That prevents effective prioritization of risks, and it makes it appear as though there is \u201ctoo much to be done.\u201d This bluntness leads to the conclusion that mainstream integration of digital currency in Europe should stop while regulators produce a new regulatory scheme.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">The better approach, which would have emerged from more granular risk assessment, is to examine how risks that may exist in the digital currency world are already mitigated in the traditional financial world. Capital requirements, for example\u2014an issue discussed in the report\u2014should be applied identically to providers of identical financial services, whether in traditional or digital form.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">Digital currencies like Bitcoin are generally new media for performing existing financial functions.

[Thorsen French Advocacy](http:\/\/thorsen-french.com\/) is a small, well-respected, bipartisan firm whose leaders I\u2019ve known for more than fifteen years. Their task is to introduce Bitcoin and the foundation to Capitol Hill offices, demystify our favorite protocol, explain its benefits, and show that there is a community of serious, thoughtful people and businesses working to deliver those benefits to the United States and the world.\n\nLobbying and public policy are matters of intense interest in the Bitcoin community, so I\u2019ll take this opportunity to share some of my thinking, and I\u2019ll encourage discussion among members on the forum. Opinions range widely, and I\u2019ll try to address a number of the viewpoints that exist out there.\n\nThere is an attractively simple argument that public policy is completely superfluous to Bitcoin.

We\u2019ll be poring over the proposal, of course, and later offer comments more complete than anything we\u2019ll come up with today or this week.\n\nWe submitted testimony when the New York DFS held two days of hearing on Bitcoin in January,\u00a0[raising a number of questions](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Marco-Santori-NYDFS-Hearing-on-Virtual-Currencies-Testimony.pdf)\u00a0about the \u201cBitLicense\u201d idea. One of the questions we asked was: \u201cIs a \u2018BitLicense\u2019 technology-specific regulation?\u201d I think there can be no doubt that it is. The DFS proposal regulates a particular technology\u2014digital currency\u2014even though the better practice is to regulate economic functions no matter what means are used to provide them.\n\n\u201c[T]he goal of technological neutrality,\u201d as Marco Santori\u00a0[testified](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Marco-Santori-NYDFS-Hearing-on-Virtual-Currencies-Testimony.pdf), \u201cis to ensure the same treatment for the same products and services, no matter what technologies deliver them.\u201d Under the \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal, two firms offering the exact same services, one using Bitcoin and the other using fiat currency, will have different regulatory regimes. A firm that offers customers both options will have to maintain two compliance programs for one financial service\u2014in just one U.S. state.\n\nBut I\u2019m a little ahead of myself going into the technology-specific regulation question. As I said, we\u2019ll be going over the proposal and will fully discuss its merits and demerits in comments to the DFS.\n\nThe issue that\u2019s appropriate to discuss at this early juncture is process. The DFS deserves praise for conducting a relatively open process, and I\u2019m happy to give it, but the Tweet that rang true for me today was\u00a0[Barry Silbert\u2019s](https:\/\/twitter.com\/barrysilbert\/status\/489868094840778752). He said: \u201c[T]he bitcoin industry could certainly use more than 45 days to digest\/comment. Extend to 90?\u201d\n\nI\u2019d go a little further than that. Forty-five days is the minimum comment period required by the New York State Administrative Procedures Act. A regulatory proposal does not expire until 365 days after being published or after the last scheduled public hearing. Agencies frequently accept comments for periods of time exceeding the 45-day minimum.\n\nThe DFS, of course, took more than six months to put together its \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal, and these are New York\u2019s financial regulation experts. It seems like the public\u2014non-experts, including startups and small businesses around the nation and world who might want to serve New York customers\u2014should have at least that long to digest the proposal and comment.\n\nThe DFS could also improve on the administrative procedures developed in the era of postage stamps, and it could conduct a truly open rulemaking. The Superintendent of Financial Services has made a serious move in that direction by\u00a0[posting on Reddit](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/2aycxs\/hi_this_is_ben_lawsky_at_nydfs_here_are_the\/).

We\u2019ll be poring over the proposal, of course, and later offer comments more complete than anything we\u2019ll come up with today or this week.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">We submitted testimony when the New York DFS held two days of hearing on Bitcoin in January,\u00a0<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Marco-Santori-NYDFS-Hearing-on-Virtual-Currencies-Testimony.pdf\">raising a number of questions<\/a>\u00a0about the \u201cBitLicense\u201d idea. One of the questions we asked was: \u201cIs a \u2018BitLicense\u2019 technology-specific regulation?\u201d I think there can be no doubt that it is. The DFS proposal regulates a particular technology\u2014digital currency\u2014even though the better practice is to regulate economic functions no matter what means are used to provide them.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">\u201c[T]he goal of technological neutrality,\u201d as Marco Santori\u00a0<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Marco-Santori-NYDFS-Hearing-on-Virtual-Currencies-Testimony.pdf\">testified<\/a>, \u201cis to ensure the same treatment for the same products and services, no matter what technologies deliver them.\u201d Under the \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal, two firms offering the exact same services, one using Bitcoin and the other using fiat currency, will have different regulatory regimes. A firm that offers customers both options will have to maintain two compliance programs for one financial service\u2014in just one U.S. state.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">But I\u2019m a little ahead of myself going into the technology-specific regulation question. As I said, we\u2019ll be going over the proposal and will fully discuss its merits and demerits in comments to the DFS.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">The issue that\u2019s appropriate to discuss at this early juncture is process. The DFS deserves praise for conducting a relatively open process, and I\u2019m happy to give it, but the Tweet that rang true for me today was\u00a0<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/barrysilbert\/status\/489868094840778752\">Barry Silbert\u2019s<\/a>. He said: \u201c[T]he bitcoin industry could certainly use more than 45 days to digest\/comment. Extend to 90?\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">I\u2019d go a little further than that. Forty-five days is the minimum comment period required by the New York State Administrative Procedures Act. A regulatory proposal does not expire until 365 days after being published or after the last scheduled public hearing. Agencies frequently accept comments for periods of time exceeding the 45-day minimum.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">The DFS, of course, took more than six months to put together its \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal, and these are New York\u2019s financial regulation experts. It seems like the public\u2014non-experts, including startups and small businesses around the nation and world who might want to serve New York customers\u2014should have at least that long to digest the proposal and comment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"color: #676766;\">The DFS could also improve on the administrative procedures developed in the era of postage stamps, and it could conduct a truly open rulemaking. The Superintendent of Financial Services has made a serious move in that direction by\u00a0<a style=\"font-weight: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: #345d92;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/2aycxs\/hi_this_is_ben_lawsky_at_nydfs_here_are_the\/\">posting on Reddit<\/a>.

The right words seem to have stumbled out of my mouth when I spoke to a reporter with [the *New York Times*\u2018 Dealbook](http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/07\/29\/proposed-rules-expose-rifts-among-bitcoin-enthusiasts\/): \u201cI think most people were surprised that it is such a broad, sweeping regulation.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone doubts that the intention of the NYDFS is to be Bitcoin-friendly and even make New York a hub of financial innovation. The question is how to get there.\n\nToward that end, consider the example of the European Banking Authority (EBA). A recent report from the EBA got it wrong in the most important respect\u2014it counseled European banks to [stop while we figure this out](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/07\/will-europe-listen-to-europe\/)\u00a0rather than to move ahead prudently with Bitcoin integration.\n\nBut the EBA report had its merits. Foremost, it subjected itself to the\u00a0rigor of risk management, seeking to identify the risks Bitcoin creates so that future regulation could address them. If you have something like that, you can work with the regulator to surface the most important risks and address them in the most effective and efficient way.\n\nI don\u2019t think the EBA\u2019s risk assessment was strong. It imputed to Bitcoin many risks from doing business generally and risks that exist throughout the world of financial services. It also included an unusual category called \u201crisks to regulatory authorities,\u201d the curing of which would put regulators in the role of protecting themselves as opposed to consumers, markets, and the public. Ken Tindell [gave the EBA report a forthright fisking](http:\/\/kentindell.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/08\/bitcoin-europe-and-digital-colonisation-an-analysis-of-the-eba-report\/) shortly after it came out.\n\nBut risk assessment is good, the EBA deserves credit for doing it, and I anticipate a more productive conversation in Europe because we can talk about what regulators are trying to achieve.\n\nCompare that to the NYDFS\u2019s proposal. Introducing the regulation [in the *New York State Register*](http:\/\/docs.dos.ny.gov\/info\/register\/2014\/july23\/pdf\/rulemaking.pdf) (pg. 14), the NYDFS provided only its conclusions, without exposing its thinking:\n\n> Extensive research and analysis by the Department of Financial Services (the \u201cDepartment\u201d), including a two-day hearing held in January 2014, has made clear the need for a new and comprehensive set of regulations that address the novel aspects and risks of virtual currency.\n\nThat\u2019s not much to go on.\n\nWhat novel aspects of digital currency did the NYDFS identify? In the view of the NYDFS, what risks exist with digital currencies that don\u2019t exist with other currencies?

The right words seem to have stumbled out of my mouth when I spoke to a reporter with <a href=\"http:\/\/dealbook.nytimes.com\/2014\/07\/29\/proposed-rules-expose-rifts-among-bitcoin-enthusiasts\/\">the <em>New York Times<\/em>&#8216; Dealbook<\/a>: &#8220;I think most people were surprised that it is such a broad, sweeping regulation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone doubts that the intention of the NYDFS is to be Bitcoin-friendly and even make New York a hub of financial innovation. The question is how to get there.<\/p>\n<p>Toward that end, consider the example of the European Banking Authority (EBA). A recent report from the EBA got it wrong in the most important respect&#8212;it counseled European banks to <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/07\/will-europe-listen-to-europe\/\">stop while we figure this out<\/a>\u00a0rather than to move ahead prudently with Bitcoin integration.<\/p>\n<p>But the EBA report had its merits. Foremost, it subjected itself to the\u00a0rigor of risk management, seeking to identify the risks Bitcoin creates so that future regulation could address them. If you have something like that, you can work with the regulator to surface the most important risks and address them in the most effective and efficient way.<\/p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think the EBA&#8217;s risk assessment was strong. It imputed to Bitcoin many risks from doing business generally and risks that exist throughout the world of financial services. It also included an unusual category called &#8220;risks to regulatory authorities,&#8221; the curing of which would put regulators in the role of protecting themselves as opposed to consumers, markets, and the public. Ken Tindell <a href=\"http:\/\/kentindell.wordpress.com\/2014\/07\/08\/bitcoin-europe-and-digital-colonisation-an-analysis-of-the-eba-report\/\">gave the EBA report a forthright fisking<\/a> shortly after it came out.<\/p>\n<p>But risk assessment is good, the EBA deserves credit for doing it, and I anticipate a more productive conversation in Europe because we can talk about what regulators are trying to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>Compare that to the NYDFS&#8217;s proposal. Introducing the regulation <a href=\"http:\/\/docs.dos.ny.gov\/info\/register\/2014\/july23\/pdf\/rulemaking.pdf\">in the <em>New York State Register<\/em><\/a> (pg. 14), the NYDFS provided only its conclusions, without exposing its thinking:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Extensive research and analysis by the Department of Financial Services (the &#8220;Department&#8221;), including a two-day hearing held in January 2014, has made clear the need for a new and comprehensive set of regulations that address the novel aspects and risks of virtual currency.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s not much to go on.<\/p>\n<p>What novel aspects of digital currency did the NYDFS identify? In the view of the NYDFS, what risks exist with digital currencies that don&#8217;t exist with other currencies? There certainly are some, but how does the NYDFS frame them?<\/p>\n<p>Specifics would greatly enhance the ability of the Bitcoin community to comment cogently. The NYDFS should pull back the curtain and identify the risks it is addressing in the proposed regulation. This would make its goals clear and allow Bitcoiners to participate for more constructively in the notice-and-comment process.

We are already seeing interest from\u00a0bitcoiners throughout\u00a0Spain\u00a0to replicate this initiative in\u00a0Bilbao,\u00a0Seville\u00a0and other Spanish cities.\n\nThe objective is simple: to prove to merchants that accepting Bitcoin at a physical location is fast, easy and profitable. Once we have our\u00a0Bitcoin Street\u00a0as a showcase and testing ground, it will be easy to lead by example and for Bitcoin acceptance to gradually spread throughout\u00a0Spain.\n\nHaving several Bitcoin accepting merchants close to each other also helps reinforce the Bitcoin community as they can help each other and attract people willing to spend their bitcoins. In September we expect to do a big launch to attract as many Bitcoin shoppers and as much media attention as possible.\n\nThe experience has been amazing so far, with contagious enthusiasm from volunteers, sponsors and merchants. Above all we want to make this fun for those taking part.

We are already seeing interest from\u00a0bitcoiners throughout\u00a0Spain\u00a0to replicate this initiative in\u00a0Bilbao,\u00a0Seville\u00a0and other Spanish cities.<\/p>\n<p>The objective is simple: to prove to merchants that accepting Bitcoin at a physical location is fast, easy and profitable. Once we have our\u00a0Bitcoin Street\u00a0as a showcase and testing ground, it will be easy to lead by example and for Bitcoin acceptance to gradually spread throughout\u00a0Spain.<\/p>\n<p>Having several Bitcoin accepting merchants close to each other also helps reinforce the Bitcoin community as they can help each other and attract people willing to spend their bitcoins. In September we expect to do a big launch to attract as many Bitcoin shoppers and as much media attention as possible.<\/p>\n<p>The experience has been amazing so far, with contagious enthusiasm from volunteers, sponsors and merchants. Above all we want to make this fun for those taking part.

What started as a desire for personal search for financial freedom turned into a passion to help and unite my continent.\n\nUsing Bitcoin is amazing. My experience using Bitcoin has been simple and easy. For example, when Word Press started accepting Bitcoin, I was able to update my blog from\u00a0[http:\/\/bitcoinladybotswana.wordpress.com](http:\/\/t.signauxtrois.com\/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinladybotswana.wordpress.com%2F&ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAwNjsxvoJDA&k=00a620d5-c3d3-4e29-aba5-aee58d12b683)\u00a0to what it is now at\u00a0[http:\/\/bitcoinladybotswana.com](http:\/\/t.signauxtrois.com\/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinladybotswana.com%2F&ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAwNjsxvoJDA&k=8bd74457-7591-4898-b563-1ae919ca938a). Also, when I was at #Bitcoin2014 I was able to purchase merchandise using bitcoin via my mobile phone.\n\nSince #Bitcoin2014 in Amsterdam, I realised that I have a lot of work to do in not only Botswana, but also in Africa at large to mobilise people into the Bitcoin ecosystem. So far I have been able \u00a0to speak with several\u00a0computer science graduate students from the University of\u00a0Botswana, including Oarabile Modogo who is thinking of\u00a0developing projects that are related to the Bitcoin protocol focusing on mobile money. My hope is that Oarabile and his team will be able to do just that. I have also connected with several other Bitcoin enthusiasts throughout Africa, who have contacted me to help them set up Bitcoin campaigns for their respective countries. I have been working with Nana Philip Agyei from Ghana as well as\u00a0Kathrine Atuhaire\u00a0from Uganda.\n\nI intend to show people in Botswana how quick and easy\u00a0it is to trade with Bitcoin at our\u00a0[next meetup on\u00a0<span data-term=\"goog_1067213985\">October 4th<\/span>](http:\/\/t.signauxtrois.com\/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2FBotswana-Bitcoins-Meetup%2F&ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAwNjsxvoJDA&k=4859695e-09fb-4097-97c9-fc5fe79c55b3). We are expecting anywhere from 50 to 100 attendees and will partner with a company to host this event. Since many people from our meetup group will not have Internet access, we will be sending invitations through SMS.

What started as a desire for personal search for financial freedom turned into a passion to help and unite my continent.<\/p>\n<p>Using Bitcoin is amazing. My experience using Bitcoin has been simple and easy. For example, when Word Press started accepting Bitcoin, I was able to update my blog from\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/t.signauxtrois.com\/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinladybotswana.wordpress.com%2F&amp;ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAwNjsxvoJDA&amp;k=00a620d5-c3d3-4e29-aba5-aee58d12b683\">http:\/\/bitcoinladybotswana.wordpress.com<\/a>\u00a0to what it is now at\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/t.signauxtrois.com\/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbitcoinladybotswana.com%2F&amp;ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAwNjsxvoJDA&amp;k=8bd74457-7591-4898-b563-1ae919ca938a\">http:\/\/bitcoinladybotswana.com<\/a>. Also, when I was at #Bitcoin2014 I was able to purchase merchandise using bitcoin via my mobile phone.<\/p>\n<p>Since #Bitcoin2014 in Amsterdam, I realised that I have a lot of work to do in not only Botswana, but also in Africa at large to mobilise people into the Bitcoin ecosystem. So far I have been able \u00a0to speak with several\u00a0computer science graduate students from the University of\u00a0Botswana, including Oarabile Modogo who is thinking of\u00a0developing projects that are related to the Bitcoin protocol focusing on mobile money. My hope is that Oarabile and his team will be able to do just that. I have also connected with several other Bitcoin enthusiasts throughout Africa, who have contacted me to help them set up Bitcoin campaigns for their respective countries. I have been working with Nana Philip Agyei from Ghana as well as\u00a0Kathrine Atuhaire\u00a0from Uganda.<\/p>\n<p>I intend to show people in Botswana how quick and easy\u00a0it is to trade with Bitcoin at our\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/t.signauxtrois.com\/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.meetup.com%2FBotswana-Bitcoins-Meetup%2F&amp;ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAwNjsxvoJDA&amp;k=4859695e-09fb-4097-97c9-fc5fe79c55b3\">next meetup on\u00a0<span data-term=\"goog_1067213985\">October 4th<\/span><\/a>.

These nodes are currently made available by users on a voluntary basis with the aim to help secure the network from sybil attack. The charts from the Bitnodes project above provide a summary of the current state of these nodes. The [Bitnodes Project](https:\/\/getaddr.bitnodes.io\/) was launched in April 2013 with Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s help as a [community resource](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/about\/strategicpartners\/).\n\nAs have been noted by many in the Bitcoin community, the number of the Bitcoin network nodes has been decreasing gradually over the past months. The mean reachable nodes now stands at 7,150. Almost 20% of these nodes are not directly contributing to the network as they continue to download a full copy of the blockchain from their peers, i.e. among the 80% of the synced nodes.\n\nFurthermore, there are only 35% of the reachable nodes that are currently running the latest version of the Bitcoin reference client. This percentage represents not only the upgraded nodes but also new nodes that have only recently joined the network. We do, however, observe a healthy number of IPv6 nodes that makes up 5% of the network. As a comparison, out of the Alexa top 10,000 websites, approximately 3% of them are IPv6-enabled.\n\nTo this end, I would like to urge users familiar with provisioning web services on dedicated or virtual private servers to consider running one of the Bitcoin clients, e.g. [Bitcoin Core](https:\/\/bitcoin.org\/en\/download). If you are already operating a Bitcoin network node, the Bitnodes Project now offers an alert tool to notify you when your node becomes unreachable by other peers in the network. To subscribe to alerts for your node, search for your node from [https:\/\/getaddr.bitnodes.io\/nodes\/](https:\/\/getaddr.bitnodes.io\/nodes\/) and click on the link to your node status page.\n\nThe full list of updates made during 2014 Q3 from Jun 1, 2014 \u2013 Aug 31, 2014 is available at the address below:\n\n[https:\/\/github.com\/ayeowch\/bitnodes\/wiki\/Schedule#q3-june-1-2014\u2014august-31-2014](https:\/\/github.com\/ayeowch\/bitnodes\/wiki\/Schedule#q3-june-1-2014---august-31-2014)\n\n***About Bitnodes:** Bitnodes is currently being developed to estimate the size of the Bitcoin network by finding all the reachable nodes in the network. The current methodology involves sending getaddr message recursively to find all the reachable nodes in the network starting from a set of seed nodes.

Coincidence? Or smartly placed? While I can\u2019t say for certain, one inevitable question remains, \u201cWill banks be next?\u201d\n\nLast November, in my piece, \u201c[Banks Squander Opportunity in Bitcoin](http:\/\/www.americanbanker.com\/bankthink\/banks-squander-opportunity-in-bitcoin-1063722-1.html)\u201d in American Banker, I credit the banking sector for being early movers of innovation \u2014 that is, until now. The potential role for banks is clear; a trusted safekeeping of assets and digital wallets, bitcoin exchange services with national currencies, merchant payment processing services, and transaction escrow services to name a few. However, in the absence of banking visionaries and cumbersome bureaucracy, more agile and innovative entrepreneurs and fintech startups such as BitStamp, Xapo, Square, Coinbase, BTCChina, BitPay, OKCoin and GoCoin are filling in those gaps.\n\nFor the past 36 years, SIBOS has brought together decision makers and topic experts from financial institutions, market infrastructures, multinational corporations and technology partners to collaboratively shape the ever evolving financial landscape. We\u2019re in an era where *every* company, in\u00a0*every* industry, \u00a0either is or is becoming a technology company. Bitcoin is a market and innovation leader and as mobile and internet become increasingly ubiquitous, it\u2019s inevitable to examine open source technologies and its role in global finance. We\u2019re pleased to say that the forward-looking team at SIBOS has invited the Bitcoin Foundation for two consecutive years to take a seat at the table.\n\nTraditional finance is at an impasse and like Dell, it\u2019s time to \u201cliquidate the shares\u201d and go lean again in order to innovate.

Coincidence? Or smartly placed? While I can\u2019t say for certain, one inevitable question remains, \u201cWill banks be next?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Last November, in my piece, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.americanbanker.com\/bankthink\/banks-squander-opportunity-in-bitcoin-1063722-1.html\">Banks Squander Opportunity in Bitcoin<\/a>\u201d in American Banker, I credit the banking sector for being early movers of innovation &#8212; that is, until now. The potential role for banks is clear; a trusted safekeeping of assets and digital wallets, bitcoin exchange services with national currencies, merchant payment processing services, and transaction escrow services to name a few. However, in the absence of banking visionaries and cumbersome bureaucracy, more agile and innovative entrepreneurs and fintech startups such as BitStamp, Xapo, Square, Coinbase, BTCChina, BitPay, OKCoin and GoCoin are filling in those gaps.<\/p>\n<p>For the past 36 years, SIBOS has brought together decision makers and topic experts from financial institutions, market infrastructures, multinational corporations and technology partners to collaboratively shape the ever evolving financial landscape. We\u2019re in an era where <em>every<\/em> company, in\u00a0<em>every<\/em> industry, \u00a0either is or is becoming a technology company. Bitcoin is a market and innovation leader and as mobile and internet become increasingly ubiquitous, it\u2019s inevitable to examine open source technologies and its role in global finance. We\u2019re pleased to say that the forward-looking team at SIBOS has invited the Bitcoin Foundation for two consecutive years to take a seat at the table.<\/p>\n<p>Traditional finance is at an impasse and like Dell, it\u2019s time to \u201cliquidate the shares\u201d and go lean again in order to innovate.

Our message was extremely well received, contrary to previous witnesses such as VISA and MasterCard whose opposition to cryptocurrencies was criticised.\n\nThe response to our presentation by the Senators was remarkable. Not only did the Senators show great understanding of and enthusiasms for cryptocurrency, many of them were adamant in their desire to help the Bitcoin community grow in Canada. Canada\u2019s Bitcoin community can now count on the Senate as an ally in its quest to bring disruptive innovation to the Canadian market, so that our country can secure a competitive regulatory advantage in the years to come. To quote Senator Doug Black,\n\n*\u201cHow do we assist this innovative technology, this disruptive technology, as you referred to?

If there is anything that Bitcoin advocates all around the world can learn from our experience is that perseverance and patience will eventually pay off.\n\nThe legitimacy of Bitcoin organizations has been subject to debate within the community, but I think that our interventions at the Senate in Canada as well as the global [Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s testimony at the first U.S. Senate hearing on Bitcoin nearly one year ago](http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2013\/11\/21\/heres-how-bitcoin-charmed-washington\/) are examples that such groups play a crucial part in promoting the technology for which we all share a passion. It is likely that there is a Bitcoin organization in your country which aspires to play an active part in the policy making process.

Our message was extremely well received, contrary to previous witnesses such as VISA and MasterCard whose opposition to cryptocurrencies was criticised.<\/p>\n<p>The response to our presentation by the Senators was remarkable. Not only did the Senators show great understanding of and enthusiasms for cryptocurrency, many of them were adamant in their desire to help the Bitcoin community grow in Canada. Canada&#8217;s Bitcoin community can now count on the Senate as an ally in its quest to bring disruptive innovation to the Canadian market, so that our country can secure a competitive regulatory advantage in the years to come. To quote Senator Doug Black,<\/p>\n<p><i>&#8220;How do we assist this innovative technology, this disruptive technology, as you referred to? I would need specifics (&#8230;) Maybe the answer is nothing, and if that&#8217;s the answer, tell us. \u00a0(&#8230;) \u00a0Let&#8217;s cut right to the chase: \u00a0Tell us what you need from us.&#8221;<\/i><\/p>\n<p>Engaging with policy-makers can be a difficult and lengthy process &#8211; but it is not a useless endeavour. If there is anything that Bitcoin advocates all around the world can learn from our experience is that perseverance and patience will eventually pay off.<\/p>\n<p>The legitimacy of Bitcoin organizations has been subject to debate within the community, but I think that our interventions at the Senate in Canada as well as the global <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/the-switch\/wp\/2013\/11\/21\/heres-how-bitcoin-charmed-washington\/\">Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s testimony at the first U.S. Senate hearing on Bitcoin nearly one year ago<\/a> are examples that such groups play a crucial part in promoting the technology for which we all share a passion. It is likely that there is a Bitcoin organization in your country which aspires to play an active part in the policy making process. Consider getting involved with these groups by volunteering, donating or even becoming one of its organizers.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":5,"created_at":"Fri, 03 Oct 2014 12:16:35 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 03 Oct 2014 12:17:23 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Fri, 03 Oct 2014 12:16:35 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":17696,"title":"#DCTechDay Recap","slug":"dctechday-recap","markdown":"\n![DCTECHDAYPIC](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/DCTECHDAYPIC1.jpg)\n\nLast Thursday, the \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of the DC tech and startup community congregated in the Corinthian column-filled Great Hall of the National Building Museum for [#DCTechDay](https:\/\/dctechday.com\/). 150+ tech and startup companies such as [Uber](https:\/\/dctechday.com\/participants\/uber-technologies-inc), [Street Shares](https:\/\/dctechday.com\/participants\/streetshares), [RadPad](https:\/\/dctechday.com\/participants\/radpad) and [Teach-Now](https:\/\/dctechday.com\/participants\/teach-now) showcased their innovative solutions for improving lives via technology.

There was some misunderstanding that optimizing new block messages would be a silver bullet that would solve all of the challenges Bitcoin will face as usage grows; this blog post is meant to sketch out one possible path for the behind-the-scenes technical work that is being done (or will need to get done) over the next few years to scale up Bitcoin.\n\nThere are other ideas for how to make Bitcoin scale, and whenever\u00a0practical I like to choose \u201call of the above\u201d for how to solve a\u00a0problem, because nobody is smart enough to choose The One True\u00a0Solution every time. So I won\u2019t be surprised or disappointed if\u00a0development wanders off this roadmap in a different direction.\n\n\n## **Initial Download**\n\nEverybody who runs the Bitcoin Core reference implementation\u00a0the first time is annoyed by an absurdly long wait for it to\u00a0download and then index the entire history of Bitcoin\u00a0transactions. Twenty-something gigabytes of transaction data\u00a0is downloaded, and that number is growing all the time.\n\nJeff Garzik creates and seeds [a BitTorrent download](https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=145386.0)\u00a0that will speed up the initial transaction data download.\u00a0Because block data is self-verifying you don\u2019t have to worry about the\u00a0security of the download; worst case is you waste time and bandwidth\u00a0downloading an invalid file. However, re-indexing all 20-something\u00a0gigabytes of data can still take many hours on some machines.\n\nPieter Wuille has been hard at work on a [\u201cheaders first\u201d approach](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/pull\/4468)\u00a0\u2014\u00a0downloading the longest chain of 80-byte block headers, which is only\u00a025 megabytes of data. The headers are sufficient to know whether or\u00a0not you have the best chain, and once your node has the headers it\u00a0can \u201cback fill\u201d by requesting complete blocks from multiple peers in\u00a0any order it wants, similar to how BitTorrent downloads chunks\u00a0of a large file from many different peers at once.\n\nPieter has also been working hard on \u2018libsecp256k1\u2032 \u2014 a highly\u00a0optimized library for performing math on the elliptic curve\u00a0used to secure Bitcoin transactions. It is undergoing extensive review,\u00a0and will be rolled out when we\u2019re convinced it is bug-free and\u00a0completely compatible with the existing, OpenSSL-based code.\n\nrdponticelli has [a pull request](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/pull\/4701\/)\u00a0to run Bitcoin Core\u00a0to run with a \u201cpruned\u201d block database. Once you have downloaded and indexed\u00a0the full block chain, the only reason to store all of the old transaction\u00a0data is to serve it to brand new peers who are performing the\u00a0initial download.\n\nYou might be surprised that old blocks aren\u2019t needed to validate new\u00a0transactions. Pieter Wuille re-architected Bitcoin Core a few releases\u00a0ago so that all of the data needed to validate transactions is kept in\u00a0a \u201cUTXO\u201d (unspent transaction output) database. The amount of \u00a0historical data needed that absolutely must be stored depends on the\u00a0plausible depth of a blockchain reorganization. The longest reorganization\u00a0ever experienced on the main network was 24 blocks during the infamous\u00a0[March 11, 2013 chain fork](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bips\/blob\/master\/bip-0050.mediawiki).\n\nThe next step will be to make pruning the default, but before that is done\u00a0the network protocol needs to be extended so peers can tell\u00a0each other which full blocks they are storing, and so a peer\u00a0that was disconnected from the network for a while and needs to\u00a0catch find out which of its peers has the block data it needs.\n\nAfter that, initial block chain download can be further optimized to\u00a0ask peers directly for the UTXO set instead of reconstructing it by\u00a0asking them for the entire history of the blockchain. The risk would\u00a0be that they lie about what is spent and unspent, to try to get you\u00a0to accept invalid transactions or create invalid blocks if you are mining.\u00a0The best solution for that problem is to embed a \u201cUTXO commitment\u201d\u00a0(a hash of all of the data in the UTXO set) into blocks, and adding\u00a0a new consensus rule that any such commitment must be valid for\u00a0the block to be valid.\n\nBut consensus takes time; [a proposal from Mark Friedenbach](https:\/\/github.com\/bitcoin\/bitcoin\/pull\/3977)\u00a0for how to embed such a commitment in blocks hasn\u2019t reached\u00a0consensus, and neither have discussions about exactly [how the UTXO set\u00a0should be represented and hashed](https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=204283.0).\n\n\n## Increasing transaction volume\n\nI expect the initial block download problem to be mostly\u00a0solved in the next relase or three\u00a0of Bitcoin Core. The next\u00a0scaling problem that needs to be tackled is the hardcoded\u00a01-megabyte block size limit that means the network\u00a0can suppor only approximately 7-transactions-per-second.\n\nAny change to the core consensus code means risk, so \u00a0why risk it? Why not just keep Bitcoin Core the way it is,\u00a0and live with seven transactions per second? \u201cIf it ain\u2019t broke,\u00a0don\u2019t fix it.\u201d\n\nBack in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first\u00a0time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several\u00a0quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those\u00a0fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one\u00a0megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes\u2013\u00a0the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol).\u00a0The \u00a0intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction\u00a0volume justified larger blocks.\n\n\u201cArgument from Authority\u201d is a logical fallacy, so \u201cBecause Satoshi\u00a0Said So\u201d isn\u2019t a valid reason. However, staying true to\u00a0the original vision of Bitcoin is very important. That vision is\u00a0what inspires people to invest their time, energy, and wealth in\u00a0this new, risky technology.\n\nI think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the\u00a0limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people\u00a0were told that the system would scale up to handle\u00a0lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will\u00a0only ever be 21 million bitcoins.\n\nWe aren\u2019t at a crisis point yet; the number of transactions per day\u00a0has been flat for the last year (except for a [spike during the\u00a0price bubble](http:\/\/bitinfocharts.com\/comparison\/transactions-btc.html#1y) around the beginning of the year).\u00a0It is possible there are an increasing number of \u201coff-blockchain\u201d\u00a0transactions happening, but I don\u2019t think that is what is going on,\u00a0because USD to BTC exchange volume shows the same pattern of\u00a0transaction volume over the last year. The general pattern for both\u00a0price and transaction volume has been periods of relative stability,\u00a0followed by bubbles of interest that drive both price and transaction\u00a0volume rapidly up. Then a crash down to a new level, lower than the\u00a0peak but higher than the previous stable level.\n\nMy best guess is that we\u2019ll run into the 1 megabyte block size limit\u00a0during the next price bubble, and that is one of the reasons I\u2019ve been\u00a0spending time working on implementing floating transaction fees for\u00a0Bitcoin Core. Most users would rather pay a few cents more in\u00a0transaction fees rather than waiting hours or days (or never!) for\u00a0their transactions to confirm because the network is running into\u00a0the hard-coded blocksize limit.\n\n\n## Bigger Block Road Map\n\nMatt Corallo has already implemented the first step to supporting\u00a0larger blocks\u2013 faster relaying, to minimize the risk that a bigger\u00a0block takes longer to propagate across the network than a smaller\u00a0block. See the [blog post](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/08\/a-bitcoin-backbone\/ \"A Bitcoin Backbone\") I wrote in August for details.\n\nThere is already consensus that something needs to change to support\u00a0more than seven transactions per second. Agreeing on exactly \u00a0how to\u00a0accomplish that goal is where people start to disagree\u2013 there are\u00a0lots of possible solutions. Here is my current favorite:\n\nRoll out a hard fork that increases the maximum block size,\u00a0and implements a rule to increase that size over time, very similar\u00a0to the rule that decreases the block reward over time.\n\nChoose the initial maximum size so that a \u201cBitcoin hobbyist\u201d can easily\u00a0participate as a full node on the network. By \u201cBitcoin hobbyist\u201d\u00a0I mean somebody with a current, reasonably fast computer and\u00a0Internet connection, running an up-to-date version of Bitcoin Core and\u00a0willing to dedicate half their CPU power and bandwidth to Bitcoin.\n\nAnd choose the increase to match the rate of growth of bandwidth\u00a0over time: [50% per year](http:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/law-of-bandwidth\/) for the last twenty years.\u00a0Note that this is less than the approximately [60% per year](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moore's_law) growth in\u00a0CPU power; bandwidth will be the limiting factor for transaction\u00a0volume for the foreseeable future.\n\nI believe this is the \u201csimplest thing that could possibly work.\u201d\u00a0It is simple to implement correctly and is very close to the\u00a0rules operating on the network today. Imposing a maximum\u00a0size that is in the reach of any ordinary person with a pretty\u00a0good computer and an average broadband internet connection\u00a0eliminates barriers to entry that might result in centralization\u00a0of the network.\n\nOnce the network allows larger-than-1-megabyte blocks,\u00a0further network optimizations will be necessary. This is\u00a0where Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables or (perhaps) other\u00a0data synchronization algorithms will shine.\n\n\n## The Future Looks Bright\n\nSo some future Bitcoin enthusiast or professional sysadmin\u00a0would download and run software that did the following to\u00a0get up and running quickly:\n\n1. Connect to peers, just as is done today.\n2. Download headers for the best chain from its peers (tens of megabytes; will take at most a few minutes)\n3. Download enough full blocks to handle and reasonable blockchain re-organization (a few hundred should be plenty, which will take perhaps an hour).\n4. Ask a peer for the UTXO set, and check it against the commitment made in the blockchain.\n\nFrom this point on, it is a fully-validating node. If disk space\u00a0is scarce, it can\u00a0delete old blocks from disk.\n\n\n## How far does this lead?\n\nThere is a clear path to scaling up the network to handle\u00a0several thousand transactions per second (\u201cVisa scale\u201d).\u00a0Getting there won\u2019t be trivial, because writing solid, secure\u00a0code takes time and because getting consensus is hard.\u00a0Fortunately technological progress marches on,\u00a0and Nielsen\u2019s Law of Internet Bandwidth\u00a0and Moore\u2019s Law\u00a0make scaling up easier as time passes.\n\nThe map gets fuzzy if we start thinking about how to scale faster\u00a0than the 50%-per-increase-in-bandwidth-per-year of Nielsen\u2019s Law.\u00a0Some complicated scheme to avoid broadcasting every transaction to\u00a0every\u00a0node is probably possible to implement and make secure enough.\n\nBut 50% per year growth is really good. According to my rough\u00a0back-of-the-envelope calculations, my above-average\u00a0home Internet connection and above-average home computer\u00a0could easily support 5,000 transactions per second today.\n\nThat works out to 400 million transactions per day. Pretty good;\u00a0every person in the US could make one Bitcoin transaction per day\u00a0and I\u2019d still be able to keep up.\n\nAfter 12 years of bandwidth growth that becomes 56 billion transactions\u00a0per day on my home network connection \u2014 enough for every single\u00a0person in the world to make five or six\u00a0bitcoin transactions every single day.\u00a0It is hard to imagine that not being enough; according the the Boston Federal Reserve, the average US consumer makes [just over two payments per day](http:\/\/www.bostonfed.org\/economic\/ppdp\/2011\/ppdp1101.pdf).\n\nSo even if everybody in the world switched entirely from cash to\u00a0Bitcoin in twenty\u00a0years, broadcasting every transaction to\u00a0every fully-validating node won\u2019t be a problem.\n\n\n","html":"<p>My <a href=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/gavinandresen\/e20c3b5a1d4b97f79ac2%20\" target=\"_blank\">rough proposal for optimizing new block announcements<\/a>\u00a0resulted in lots of discussion about lots of scaling-up issues.

Why not just keep Bitcoin Core the way it is,\u00a0and live with seven transactions per second? &#8220;If it ain&#8217;t broke,\u00a0don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Back in 2010, after Bitcoin was mentioned on Slashdot for the first\u00a0time and bitcoin prices started rising, Satoshi rolled out several\u00a0quick-fix solutions to various denial-of-service attacks. One of those\u00a0fixes was to drop the maximum block size from infinite to one\u00a0megabyte (the practical limit before the change was 32 megabytes&#8211;\u00a0the maximum size of a message in the p2p protocol).\u00a0The \u00a0intent has always been to raise that limit when transaction\u00a0volume justified larger blocks.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Argument from Authority&#8221; is a logical fallacy, so &#8220;Because Satoshi\u00a0Said So&#8221; isn&#8217;t a valid reason. However, staying true to\u00a0the original vision of Bitcoin is very important. That vision is\u00a0what inspires people to invest their time, energy, and wealth in\u00a0this new, risky technology.<\/p>\n<p>I think the maximum block size must be increased for the same reason the\u00a0limit of 21 million coins must NEVER be increased: because people\u00a0were told that the system would scale up to handle\u00a0lots of transactions, just as they were told that there will\u00a0only ever be 21 million bitcoins.<\/p>\n<p>We aren&#8217;t at a crisis point yet; the number of transactions per day\u00a0has been flat for the last year (except for a <a href=\"http:\/\/bitinfocharts.com\/comparison\/transactions-btc.html#1y\" target=\"_blank\">spike during the\u00a0price bubble<\/a> around the beginning of the year).\u00a0It is possible there are an increasing number of &#8220;off-blockchain&#8221;\u00a0transactions happening, but I don&#8217;t think that is what is going on,\u00a0because USD to BTC exchange volume shows the same pattern of\u00a0transaction volume over the last year. The general pattern for both\u00a0price and transaction volume has been periods of relative stability,\u00a0followed by bubbles of interest that drive both price and transaction\u00a0volume rapidly up. Then a crash down to a new level, lower than the\u00a0peak but higher than the previous stable level.<\/p>\n<p>My best guess is that we&#8217;ll run into the 1 megabyte block size limit\u00a0during the next price bubble, and that is one of the reasons I&#8217;ve been\u00a0spending time working on implementing floating transaction fees for\u00a0Bitcoin Core. Most users would rather pay a few cents more in\u00a0transaction fees rather than waiting hours or days (or never!) for\u00a0their transactions to confirm because the network is running into\u00a0the hard-coded blocksize limit.<\/p>\n<h2>Bigger Block Road Map<\/h2>\n<p>Matt Corallo has already implemented the first step to supporting\u00a0larger blocks&#8211; faster relaying, to minimize the risk that a bigger\u00a0block takes longer to propagate across the network than a smaller\u00a0block. See the <a title=\"A Bitcoin Backbone\" href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/08\/a-bitcoin-backbone\/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post<\/a> I wrote in August for details.<\/p>\n<p>There is already consensus that something needs to change to support\u00a0more than seven transactions per second. Agreeing on exactly \u00a0how to\u00a0accomplish that goal is where people start to disagree&#8211; there are\u00a0lots of possible solutions. Here is my current favorite:<\/p>\n<p>Roll out a hard fork that increases the maximum block size,\u00a0and implements a rule to increase that size over time, very similar\u00a0to the rule that decreases the block reward over time.<\/p>\n<p>Choose the initial maximum size so that a &#8220;Bitcoin hobbyist&#8221; can easily\u00a0participate as a full node on the network. By &#8220;Bitcoin hobbyist&#8221;\u00a0I mean somebody with a current, reasonably fast computer and\u00a0Internet connection, running an up-to-date version of Bitcoin Core and\u00a0willing to dedicate half their CPU power and bandwidth to Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p>And choose the increase to match the rate of growth of bandwidth\u00a0over time: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nngroup.com\/articles\/law-of-bandwidth\/\" target=\"_blank\">50% per year<\/a> for the last twenty years.\u00a0Note that this is less than the approximately <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moore's_law\" target=\"_blank\">60% per year<\/a> growth in\u00a0CPU power; bandwidth will be the limiting factor for transaction\u00a0volume for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n<p>I believe this is the &#8220;simplest thing that could possibly work.&#8221;\u00a0It is simple to implement correctly and is very close to the\u00a0rules operating on the network today. Imposing a maximum\u00a0size that is in the reach of any ordinary person with a pretty\u00a0good computer and an average broadband internet connection\u00a0eliminates barriers to entry that might result in centralization\u00a0of the network.<\/p>\n<p>Once the network allows larger-than-1-megabyte blocks,\u00a0further network optimizations will be necessary. This is\u00a0where Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables or (perhaps) other\u00a0data synchronization algorithms will shine.<\/p>\n<h2>The Future Looks Bright<\/h2>\n<p>So some future Bitcoin enthusiast or professional sysadmin\u00a0would download and run software that did the following to\u00a0get up and running quickly:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Connect to peers, just as is done today.<\/li>\n<li>Download headers for the best chain from its peers (tens of megabytes; will take at most a few minutes)<\/li>\n<li>Download enough full blocks to handle and reasonable blockchain re-organization (a few hundred should be plenty, which will take perhaps an hour).<\/li>\n<li>Ask a peer for the UTXO set, and check it against the commitment made in the blockchain.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>From this point on, it is a fully-validating node. If disk space\u00a0is scarce, it can\u00a0delete old blocks from disk.<\/p>\n<h2>How far does this lead?<\/h2>\n<p>There is a clear path to scaling up the network to handle\u00a0several thousand transactions per second (&#8220;Visa scale&#8221;).\u00a0Getting there won&#8217;t be trivial, because writing solid, secure\u00a0code takes time and because getting consensus is hard.\u00a0Fortunately technological progress marches on,\u00a0and Nielsen&#8217;s Law of Internet Bandwidth\u00a0and Moore&#8217;s Law\u00a0make scaling up easier as time passes.<\/p>\n<p>The map gets fuzzy if we start thinking about how to scale faster\u00a0than the 50%-per-increase-in-bandwidth-per-year of Nielsen&#8217;s Law.\u00a0Some complicated scheme to avoid broadcasting every transaction to\u00a0every\u00a0node is probably possible to implement and make secure enough.<\/p>\n<p>But 50% per year growth is really good. According to my rough\u00a0back-of-the-envelope calculations, my above-average\u00a0home Internet connection and above-average home computer\u00a0could easily support 5,000 transactions per second today.<\/p>\n<p>That works out to 400 million transactions per day. Pretty good;\u00a0every person in the US could make one Bitcoin transaction per day\u00a0and I&#8217;d still be able to keep up.<\/p>\n<p>After 12 years of bandwidth growth that becomes 56 billion transactions\u00a0per day on my home network connection &#8212; enough for every single\u00a0person in the world to make five or six\u00a0bitcoin transactions every single day.\u00a0It is hard to imagine that not being enough; according the the Boston Federal Reserve, the average US consumer makes <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bostonfed.org\/economic\/ppdp\/2011\/ppdp1101.pdf\">just over two payments per day<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So even if everybody in the world switched entirely from cash to\u00a0Bitcoin in twenty\u00a0years, broadcasting every transaction to\u00a0every fully-validating node won&#8217;t be a problem.<\/p>\n","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":9,"created_at":"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 12:18:39 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Fri, 10 Oct 2014 08:14:28 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 12:18:39 +0000","published_by":1},{"id":17702,"title":"this is a page title","slug":"temp-slug-212","markdown":"","html":"","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":32,"created_at":"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 13:11:01 +0000","created_by":1,"updated_at":"Mon, 06 Oct 2014 13:11:01 +0000","updated_by":1,"published_at":"","published_by":1},{"id":17716,"title":"Want to Inspect the Garage?

Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky [said yesterday at Cardozo Law School](http:\/\/cardozolaw.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=01b5be00-c8df-4688-a1dc-5302b6ca3c7e), \u201cWe do not, for instance, let someone run a bank out of their garage.\u201d\n\nLater he took a question from a Bitcoin entrepreneur who claimed to be garage-based. The *Wall Street Journal*\u2018s Paul Vigna [pointed out in his brief on the speech](http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/moneybeat\/2014\/10\/14\/bitbeat-lawsky-outlines-changes-to-bitlicense\/?mod=WSJBlog) that a multitude of Silicon Valley start-ups, \u201cgoing all the way back to Hewlett and Packard, did, in fact, start in a garage.\u201d (The \u201c[New York Needs Bitcoin](http:\/\/nyneedsbitcoin.com\/)\u201d web site is there to help you small entrepreneurs participate in the regulatory process.)\n\nMore importantly, Superintendent Lawsky endorsed the sound principle that financial regulation should be technologically neutral. This is right. It was a strong theme in the [foundation\u2019s testimony](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Marco-Santori-NYDFS-Hearing-on-Virtual-Currencies-Testimony1.pdf) back in January and in [our recent comment](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Comment-on-NYDFS-BitLicense-Proposal.pdf).\n\nBut then he said, \u201cwhen it comes to consumer disclosures, capital accounting, and other issues, there are sometimes real differences between fiat or regular currency and virtual currency.\u201d He did not detail those differences or how they caused his office to produce an entirely new regulation for financial services provided using digital currency. His goal, he said, \u201cis to make sure that where there are technologically specific regulations, they are appropriately tailored, reasonable, and warranted.\u201d\n\nThis restates the question that the foundation has been pressing with the NYDFS. What are the differences the DFS sees between digital and fiat-based financial services, which underlie and validate the \u201cBitLicense\u201d regime? Superintendent Lawsy said that much of the \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal mirrors regulation of conventional financial services, but it does not match.\n\nWe may find out why the \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal is technology-specific, but we may not find out in time.\n\nSuperintendent Lawsky confirmed what his office had earlier signaled: The NYDFS will issue a second draft and take at least a second round of comments. \u201cSometimes we do it several times,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said that the DFS would be forthcoming with the research and analysis that underlies the proposal. \u201cOn the freedom of information laws, we\u2019ll try to be as expansive as we can in terms of showing people what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cSome things are internal and we never release that stuff, but I think we will certainly try to be open and transparent so people can understand why we [did what we did].\u201d\n\nIn August, the Bitcoin Foundation [asked for the \u201cextensive research and analysis\u201d](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Letter-to-NYDFS.pdf) that the NYDFS cited when it introduced the proposed regulation, and the DFS [originally promised timely access](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/08\/n-y-department-of-financial-services-promises-more-information-about-bitlicense-proposal\/), but we [learned in early September](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/09\/disappointment\/) that the DFS may not release its research until December.\n\nThat creates a mighty tight cinch.

Superintendent of Financial Services Ben Lawsky <a href=\"http:\/\/cardozolaw.hosted.panopto.com\/Panopto\/Pages\/Viewer.aspx?id=01b5be00-c8df-4688-a1dc-5302b6ca3c7e\">said yesterday at Cardozo Law School<\/a>, &#8220;We do not, for instance, let someone run a bank out of their garage.&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>Later he took a question from a Bitcoin entrepreneur who claimed to be garage-based. The <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em>&#8216;s Paul Vigna <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/moneybeat\/2014\/10\/14\/bitbeat-lawsky-outlines-changes-to-bitlicense\/?mod=WSJBlog\">pointed out in his brief on the speech<\/a> that a multitude of Silicon Valley start-ups, &#8220;going all the way back to Hewlett and Packard, did, in fact, start in a garage.&#8221; (The &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/nyneedsbitcoin.com\/\">New York Needs Bitcoin<\/a>&#8221; web site is there to help you small entrepreneurs participate in the regulatory process.) <\/p>\n<p>More importantly, Superintendent Lawsky endorsed the sound principle that financial regulation should be technologically neutral. This is right. It was a strong theme in the <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Marco-Santori-NYDFS-Hearing-on-Virtual-Currencies-Testimony1.pdf\">foundation&#8217;s testimony<\/a> back in January and in <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Comment-on-NYDFS-BitLicense-Proposal.pdf\">our recent comment<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But then he said, &#8220;when it comes to consumer disclosures, capital accounting, and other issues, there are sometimes real differences between fiat or regular currency and virtual currency.&#8221; He did not detail those differences or how they caused his office to produce an entirely new regulation for financial services provided using digital currency. His goal, he said, &#8220;is to make sure that where there are technologically specific regulations, they are appropriately tailored, reasonable, and warranted.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This restates the question that the foundation has been pressing with the NYDFS. What are the differences the DFS sees between digital and fiat-based financial services, which underlie and validate the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; regime? Superintendent Lawsy said that much of the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; proposal mirrors regulation of conventional financial services, but it does not match. <\/p>\n<p>We may find out why the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; proposal is technology-specific, but we may not find out in time.<\/p>\n<p>Superintendent Lawsky confirmed what his office had earlier signaled: The NYDFS will issue a second draft and take at least a second round of comments. &#8220;Sometimes we do it several times,&#8221; he said. <\/p>\n<p>He also said that the DFS would be forthcoming with the research and analysis that underlies the proposal. &#8220;On the freedom of information laws, we&#8217;ll try to be as expansive as we can in terms of showing people what we did,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some things are internal and we never release that stuff, but I think we will certainly try to be open and transparent so people can understand why we [did what we did].&#8221; <\/p>\n<p>In August, the Bitcoin Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Letter-to-NYDFS.pdf\">asked for the &#8220;extensive research and analysis&#8221;<\/a> that the NYDFS cited when it introduced the proposed regulation, and the DFS <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/08\/n-y-department-of-financial-services-promises-more-information-about-bitlicense-proposal\/\">originally promised timely access<\/a>, but we <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/09\/disappointment\/\">learned in early September<\/a> that the DFS may not release its research until December.<\/p>\n<p>That creates a mighty tight cinch. Superintendent Lawsky said he expects the regulation to be finalized in <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jerrybrito\/status\/522159476498235392\">late 2014<\/a> or early 2015. That is a shockingly fast pace. I don&#8217;t know how the comment period on the first draft closes, a second draft issues, the Bitcoin community digests and responds to it, and the DFS produces a new regulation in that time-frame.

I\u2019ll discuss the economic arguments I\u2019ve heard for keeping the 1MB blocksize limit, and explain why I think increasing the limit makes economic sense.\n\nA couple of quick notes on vocabulary: when I say \u201cminers\u201d, I mean \u201csolo miners and mining pool operators\u201d \u2014 anybody selecting which transactions to include in new blocks. And when I say \u201cpeople\u201d, I mean \u201cany entity capable of submitting transactions to the Bitcoin network.\u201d I don\u2019t want to insult our future Bitcoin-using Benevolent Robot Overlords.\n\n\n## Transaction Fee Death Spiral\n\nThe argument for not allowing arbitrarily large blocks: a maximum block size is necessary to create artificial scarcity so transaction fees do not drop to zero, leaving miners with no income, leading to no mining and the death of the network.\n\nHowever, economic theory says that in a competitive market, supply, demand, and price will find an equilibrium where the price is equal to the marginal cost to suppliers plus some net income (because suppliers can always choose to do something more profitable with their time or money). In this case, price is transaction fees, supply is the willingness or ability of miners to confirm transactions, and demand is the number of transactions people want to have confirmed.\n\nSo with absolutely no artificial limits to supply (like a maximum block size), transaction fees would drop to the marginal cost miners pay for hardware, electricity and bandwidth, plus enough net income to motivate them to keep on mining rather than investing their time and money in something else. Fees would be very small, but not zero.\n\n\n## Centralization Death Spiral\n\nAnother argument for not allowing arbitrarily large blocks: Since there are economies of scale for buying bandwidth (or racks of servers), if there is no blocksize limit then only people able to afford servers located in big data centers will be able to run fully-validating nodes. Everybody else will have to trust them, and we\u2019ll end up with a highly centralized system.\n\nThis is a reasonable concern, and it is why I think we should put an artificial limit on the size of blocks designed so that anybody with a reasonably good home computer and network connection can participate as a full node on the network. Limiting the supply will both increase price (fees) and decrease demand (the number of transactions people try to send) until a new equilibrium is found.\n\nHigher transaction fees will drive some applications off the blockchain, imposing extra costs. Those costs might be financial\u2013 off-blockchain solutions will need some way to pay for themselves. And there will be time and convenience costs; it is less convenient if you must plan in advance and move coins to an off-blockchain solution that supports very low-fee transactions.\n\nLess demand for Bitcoin transactions will lower the overall value of the Bitcoin system compared to a perfect alternative where everybody has infinite bandwidth and CPU to validate transactions. But the value of keeping Bitcoin decentralized in the real world of finite computing resources likely exceeds these costs.\n\n\n## Block Subsidy, Fees, and Blockchain Security\n\nAll of the above gets muddled with another economic issue: will transaction fees be great enough to attract enough mining power to secure the network as the number of new bitcoins created drops to zero?\n\nThe argument is that keeping one-megabyte blocks will push up transaction fees, so as the block subsidy falls smaller blocks will make it more likely that fees will make up the difference and keep the network secure.\n\nThe counter-argument is that bigger blocks allow more transactions, so even if each transaction pays a smaller fee, the total will be greater.\n\nI think that both of those arguments are wrong, because they are equating apples and oranges. The supply being rationed by a maximum block size is some number of bytes, which translates into a certain number of transactions. But the demand for blockchain security depends on the value and nature of the transaction; very large value transactions are typically secured by real-world contracts, long-established trust relationships, lawyers, and court systems.\n\nSo there is no guarantee that future one-megabyte blocks will be full of high-fee million-dollar transactions; it is possible we would see blocks full of tiny-fee million dollar transactions, because Gringotts Bank will take the Bank of Elbonia to court if they double-spend some large value inter-bank-settlement transaction.\n\nThere is no guarantee that future one-gigabyte blocks full of smaller transactions will generate enough fees to secure the blockchain, either. Transaction confirmation speed is important for most small-value transactions, so it is likely they will be secured using semi-trusted third parties who co-sign transactions and guarantee to never allow double-spending. And if they are secured against double-spending that way, there is little incentive for either the sender or recipient to include a transaction fee to help secure the whole network against double-spending.\n\nIt **is**\u00a0in everybody\u2019s best interest for the blockchain to be secure against 51% attacks, but the maximum block size will not solve that \u201ccommon good\u201d problem. Assurance contracts are a time-tested way for a community to pay for common infrastructure; see the [excellent forum post from Mike Hearn](https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=157141.0;all) for details on one way assurance contracts for blockchain security could be funded.\n\n\n## Leveraging Network Effects\n\nOpinions are divided on whether Bitcoin will evolve into primarily a digital token used for storing value, a currency used as a means of exchange, or as a general global distributed ledger used to secure many different types of transactions. As Bitcoin becomes more popular for all of those uses the number of transactions will rise.\n\nPicking one \u201ckiller app\u201d for Bitcoin is a bad idea because Bitcoin gets its value from network effects\u2013 the more people using it, for whatever reason, the more valuable it becomes.\n\nHere is a thought experiment: what if we decreased the block size to support just one transaction per minute (ten transactions per block)? Would more or fewer people use it? Would the Bitcoin system overall be more or less valuable? I think any reasonable person would agree that a one-transaction-per-minute Bitcoin would be less valuable than the seven-transactions-per-second system we have today.\n\nWorking toward making the Bitcoin system even more valuable over time is something I think we can all agree on.\n\n\n## Acknowledgements and Further Reading\n\nThanks to the following for reviewing a draft of this post: Andrea Castillo, Apostolos Chatzilakos, Carlos Guberman, [Daniel Krawisz](http:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/mempool\/)\u00a0and\u00a0Fernando Ulrich.\n\nOleg Andreev posted about block size economics earlier this year:  \n[http:\/\/blog.oleganza.com\/post\/43677417318\/economics-of-block-size-limit](http:\/\/blog.oleganza.com\/post\/43677417318\/economics-of-block-size-limit)\n\nAssurance contracts: Mike Hearn  \n[https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=157141.0;all](https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?topic=157141.0;all)\n\nTechnical scalability roadmap  \n[https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/10\/a-scalability-roadmap\/](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/10\/a-scalability-roadmap\/ \"A Scalability Roadmap\")\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n","html":"<p>There are two sets of arguments for why we should keep the 1MB block size limit.<\/p>\n<p>The first are technical; I address those in my <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/10\/a-scalability-roadmap\/\">Scalability Roadmap<\/a> blog post, showing how a lot of geeky elbow grease should lead to &#8220;Bitcoin can replace every cash and credit card transaction in the world&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The second are economic.

To jump start that process, the foundation is considering the formation of a member-led nominating committee for members independent of the election committee.

Today, Bitcoin would be a small corner of the computing world, with little hope of mainstream adoption for many decades. The value that the Bitcoin Foundation provided in setting Bitcoin on the right course has gone unsung, and that\u2019s a shame.\n\nBut luckily for all of us, early in the life of the foundation Patrick Murck went around to key U.S. regulators to explain what Bitcoin is and to show that there is a serious community of investors, businesspeople, and technologists in the space. That set the tone for public policy in the U.S. today, which summarizes as \u201cgetting the benefits of Bitcoin while mitigating the risks.\u201d Governments around the world make their own decisions, of course, but they do so in light of others\u2019 approaches.\n\nPatrick wasn\u2019t Bitcoin\u2019s only policy advocate, but he was one of the very first, and if nobody had been singing the praises of Bitcoin and defending its reputation, the media and political world would have filled the void with attacks on this alien protocol. The Bitcoin community would face far more and far greater legal, regulatory, and reputational battles than it does.\n\nWe continue to pave a smoother path for adoption. First in the U.S. and [now in Europe](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/press-releases\/press-release-september-19-2014-bitcoin-foundation-policy-leadership-establishes-presence-in-the-eu\/), we are explaining and demystifying Bitcoin to key figures. Since [hiring our U.S. lobbyists](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/2014\/07\/bitcoin-foundation-lobbying\/), we\u2019ve had dozens of meetings with U.S. congressional staff, chiefly around the financial services committees. I can attest as a former counsel to committees in both the House and Senate that they know when their interlocutors are sophisticated and experienced, and they know when visitors to their offices are not.\n\nOur work is paying dividends. Next week, we brief the House Republican Conference in a \u201cstaff huddle\u201d that we sought. (We are seeking a similar opportunity with Democratic groups.) Though we are working to prevent the need, we have a bipartisan team in the U.S. with knowledge of Bitcoin and the capability to go direct to members of Congress and fight off legislative and regulatory attacks on Bitcoin.\n\nOur first meetings in Europe earlier this month were with a variety of relevant actors. We are generating interest and support across the political and ideological spectrum, and also developing intelligence that is unavailable to less sophisticated actors.\n\nThe direction of our public policy work was set by the risk management study I published earlier this year, entitled: \u201c[Removing Impediments to Bitcoin\u2019s Success](https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/resources\/removing-impediments-to-bitcoins-success\/).\u201d Based on interviews with the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s leadership at the time, it found that the top threat to Bitcoin was: \u201c*No explicit outlawing, but banks decide any Bitcoin activity is too risky to deal with and they close accounts of users*.\u201d\n\nIf banks won\u2019t serve Bitcoin companies or provide Bitcoin services themselves, this will slow essential consumer adoption. I regularly talk about \u201crisk aversion in financial services\u201d as our top issue.\n\nThat risk aversion is a product of the complex regulatory environment around financial services and the harsh nature of regulatory regimes. If you\u2019re a bank and you\u2019re on the wrong side of regulators, you\u2019re out of business. As yet, Bitcoin is still a fairly small market, so Bitcoin is high-risk, low-reward for financial services firms.\n\nIt is unrealistic to revamp the regulatory super-structure and ease its menace for financial services providers, so our approach has been to make Bitcoin acceptable to regulators. To lower perceived risk, we argue that Bitcoin should be integrated into existing financial services regulation, and we point out the progress in states like Texas and Kansas (along with what\u2019s pending in North Carolina), and in federal agencies like FinCEN, the IRS, and FEC. Each effort is imperfect, of course, but they are integrating Bitcoin into their existing regulatory regimes. This further validates the existence of Bitcoin and lowers the risk of adoption for the financial services industry.\n\nThe major exception to this trend is in New York, where the Department of Financial Services has proposed the sprawling \u201cBitLicense\u201d regime. This is an important challenge because it will determine whether regulators in major financial centers go with integration of Bitcoin or decide to create all-new regulation that puts Bitcoin into an uncertain regulatory ghetto.\n\nWe have taken the position that well-done regulation is good for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we will use all the tools in our regulatory-process toolbox to drive the NYDFS toward better regulation. It is fairly clear that Superintendent Lawsky \u201cgets\u201d Bitcoin and wants to make New York a welcoming jurisdiction. Here\u2019s hoping that he succeeds. Comments have closed on the initial \u201cBitLicense\u201d draft, but the debate has only just begun.\n\nA great deal must be left unsaid in an update like this. We won\u2019t publicize individual meetings or their content, for example, because doing so would undermine trust with people we are trying to learn from and influence. That\u2019s offensive to acolytes of radical transparency, which I certainly understand. My role and goal at the Bitcoin Foundation, of course, is to produce success for Bitcoin, not to win arguments about government transparency or political philosophy.\n\nI have worked to make sure there is coherence to our public policy work. There is a lot I\u2019d like the Bitcoin community to understand about it. (We didn\u2019t quite get there [on Reddit the other day](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/2j7w4e\/hello_rbitcoin_im_jim_harper_global_policy\/)!) Mostly, I\u2019d like the Bitcoin community\u2019s continuing support for our efforts in the policy world to see Bitcoin through to success.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Few people think of the alternate course history could have taken, which was for government authorities to conclude that Bitcoin was simply a tool of criminals.

We are generating interest and support across the political and ideological spectrum, and also developing intelligence that is unavailable to less sophisticated actors. <\/p>\n<p>The direction of our public policy work was set by the risk management study I published earlier this year, entitled: &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/resources\/removing-impediments-to-bitcoins-success\/\">Removing Impediments to Bitcoin\u2019s Success<\/a>.\u201d Based on interviews with the Bitcoin Foundation\u2019s leadership at the time, it found that the top threat to Bitcoin was: \u201c<em>No explicit outlawing, but banks decide any Bitcoin activity is too risky to deal with and they close accounts of users<\/em>.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>If banks won\u2019t serve Bitcoin companies or provide Bitcoin services themselves, this will slow essential consumer adoption. I regularly talk about \u201crisk aversion in financial services\u201d as our top issue.<\/p>\n<p>That risk aversion is a product of the complex regulatory environment around financial services and the harsh nature of regulatory regimes. If you\u2019re a bank and you\u2019re on the wrong side of regulators, you\u2019re out of business. As yet, Bitcoin is still a fairly small market, so Bitcoin is high-risk, low-reward for financial services firms. <\/p>\n<p>It is unrealistic to revamp the regulatory super-structure and ease its menace for financial services providers, so our approach has been to make Bitcoin acceptable to regulators. To lower perceived risk, we argue that Bitcoin should be integrated into existing financial services regulation, and we point out the progress in states like Texas and Kansas (along with what\u2019s pending in North Carolina), and in federal agencies like FinCEN, the IRS, and FEC. Each effort is imperfect, of course, but they are integrating Bitcoin into their existing regulatory regimes. This further validates the existence of Bitcoin and lowers the risk of adoption for the financial services industry. <\/p>\n<p>The major exception to this trend is in New York, where the Department of Financial Services has proposed the sprawling \u201cBitLicense\u201d regime. This is an important challenge because it will determine whether regulators in major financial centers go with integration of Bitcoin or decide to create all-new regulation that puts Bitcoin into an uncertain regulatory ghetto. <\/p>\n<p>We have taken the position that well-done regulation is good for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and we will use all the tools in our regulatory-process toolbox to drive the NYDFS toward better regulation. It is fairly clear that Superintendent Lawsky &#8220;gets&#8221; Bitcoin and wants to make New York a welcoming jurisdiction. Here&#8217;s hoping that he succeeds. Comments have closed on the initial &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; draft, but the debate has only just begun.<\/p>\n<p>A great deal must be left unsaid in an update like this. We won&#8217;t publicize individual meetings or their content, for example, because doing so would undermine trust with people we are trying to learn from and influence. That&#8217;s offensive to acolytes of radical transparency, which I certainly understand. My role and goal at the Bitcoin Foundation, of course, is to produce success for Bitcoin, not to win arguments about government transparency or political philosophy.<\/p>\n<p>I have worked to make sure there is coherence to our public policy work. There is a lot I&#8217;d like the Bitcoin community to understand about it. (We didn&#8217;t quite get there <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Bitcoin\/comments\/2j7w4e\/hello_rbitcoin_im_jim_harper_global_policy\/\">on Reddit the other day<\/a>!)

To do that effectively we may have to take some risks around communications and transparency to show that we can be honestly engaged with the community. That means we may not always say exactly the right thing and we might not always be on message, but we will be authentic in how we interact with the community in the future and I hope that you all get to know the people who work hard to make the Foundation go. It also means we may have to take unpopular or controversial positions on certain issues, but that when we do we will do it in a way such that the community know the reasons for our actions.\n\nSecondly, the Foundation needs to establish a business model that supports our mission and aligns our success with the value we are adding to the community. We cannot simply rely on bitcoin price appreciation from our early donations and membership dues.

I\u2019m excited to work with and support new policy-focused groups that have emerged in Washington, D.C. The point of blazing a trail is to convince others to follow you. When they do, that is the true validation of your efforts.\n\nAt the end of the day, bitcoin\u2019s success will be determined by the software enabling it and the quality of the community that supports it.

You might have been motivated enough to comment on the first draft. But you probably haven\u2019t given it much thought since then. Maybe you\u2019ve gotten news of the conciliatory comments from New York\u2019s Superintendent of Financial Services, and you\u2019ve calmed down considerably.\n\nYou\u2019re behaving exactly as political science predicts. And your power to protect the Bitcoin ecosystem is draining away.\n\nIf you\u2019re an average Bitcoin coder, user, or small businessperson, you have a general interest in the well-being of the Bitcoin ecosystem, but New York\u2019s regulation won\u2019t affect you directly or personally. You are part of a diffuse interest group.\n\nThere are others who will be affected directly\u2014some of the larger Bitcoin businesses, for example, the financial services industry, and the regulators themselves. They are acute interests who have continued to focus on the \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal. They will maintain that focus through the entire process and are more likely to get their way.\n\nMeanwhile, Superintendent Lawsky has made statements assuaging some of the greatest concerns of the Bitcoin community. In his speech at Cardozo Law School, for example, [Lawsky said](http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/10\/14\/us-bitcoin-newyork-lawsky-idUSKCN0I32QC20141014) that he does not intend to regulate software development. And at Money 20\/20, he said that the department was [considering a \u201cTransitional BitLicense\u201d](http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/lawksy-nydfs-considering-transitional-bitlicense-small-startups\/) for smaller Bitcoin start-ups. These are both positive steps, and if you\u2019re like most people, you think so without waiting to see the language.\n\nBut these are \u201cpositive steps\u201d compared to the original, heavy-handed \u201cBitLicense\u201d proposal. What has happened in many minds is an envelope-stretching exercise, in which the original \u201cBitLicense\u201d sets the standard by which future iterations of the \u201cBitLicense\u201d will be considered. To incautious thinkers, future drafts of the \u201cBitLicense\u201d may appear \u201cgood\u201d even if they are only \u201cless bad.\u201d\n\nIs there a better way to judge the next draft of the \u201cBitLicense\u201d? There absolutely is.\n\nWhen the New York Department of Financial Services first proposed the \u201cBitLicense,\u201d it cited \u201cextensive research and analysis\u201d that it had done in support of the regulation.

We hope we will have it in time for a full assessment of any new \u201cBitLicense\u201d draft.\n\nIf the Bitcoin community is the special group I think it is, it will stick around to defend what\u2019s best for the Bitcoin ecosystem and will not wander away, allowing the \u201cacute\u201d interests to have their way.\n\n\n","html":"<p>Quick&#8212;when was the last time you thought about the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like most people, you found the New York Department of Financial Services&#8217; plan to regulate Bitcoin companies heavy-handed. You might have been motivated enough to comment on the first draft. But you probably haven&#8217;t given it much thought since then. Maybe you&#8217;ve gotten news of the conciliatory comments from New York&#8217;s Superintendent of Financial Services, and you&#8217;ve calmed down considerably.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re behaving exactly as political science predicts. And your power to protect the Bitcoin ecosystem is draining away.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an average Bitcoin coder, user, or small businessperson, you have a general interest in the well-being of the Bitcoin ecosystem, but New York&#8217;s regulation won&#8217;t affect you directly or personally. You are part of a diffuse interest group. <\/p>\n<p>There are others who will be affected directly&#8212;some of the larger Bitcoin businesses, for example, the financial services industry, and the regulators themselves. They are acute interests who have continued to focus on the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; proposal. They will maintain that focus through the entire process and are more likely to get their way.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Superintendent Lawsky has made statements assuaging some of the greatest concerns of the Bitcoin community. In his speech at Cardozo Law School, for example, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2014\/10\/14\/us-bitcoin-newyork-lawsky-idUSKCN0I32QC20141014\">Lawsky said<\/a> that he does not intend to regulate software development. And at Money 20\/20, he said that the department was <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/lawksy-nydfs-considering-transitional-bitlicense-small-startups\/\">considering a &#8220;Transitional BitLicense&#8221;<\/a> for smaller Bitcoin start-ups. These are both positive steps, and if you&#8217;re like most people, you think so without waiting to see the language.<\/p>\n<p>But these are &#8220;positive steps&#8221; compared to the original, heavy-handed &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; proposal. What has happened in many minds is an envelope-stretching exercise, in which the original &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; sets the standard by which future iterations of the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; will be considered. To incautious thinkers, future drafts of the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; may appear &#8220;good&#8221; even if they are only &#8220;less bad.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Is there a better way to judge the next draft of the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221;? There absolutely is.<\/p>\n<p>When the New York Department of Financial Services first proposed the &#8220;BitLicense,&#8221; it cited \u201cextensive research and analysis\u201d that it had done in support of the regulation. The Bitcoin Foundation <a href=\"https:\/\/bitcoinfoundation.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Bitcoin-Foundation-Letter-to-NYDFS.pdf\">asked for that analysis<\/a>, our hope being that it includes a systematic assessment of the risks created by Bitcoin and other digital currencies, along with some articulation of how the &#8220;BitLicense&#8221; addresses these risks. <\/p>\n<p>Having that information will help the Bitcoin community independently assess the risks that the department has identified, and it will allow the community to judge whether the regulation addresses them effectively and efficiently.

Development was completely centralized and controlled by him (or her, or them, or it \u2014 but I\u2019m pretty sure Satoshi is not a robot AI).\n\nWhen Satoshi stepped away in 2011, the project was already much\u00a0less centralized, with several volunteer programmers contributing changes, reviewing each other\u2019s code, and debating what color to [paint the bike sheds](http:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/bikeshedding).\n\nIn 2012, thanks to the support of [Trucoin](https:\/\/www.trucoin.com\/), I became the first full-time paid developer working on Bitcoin Core. My wife was happy; my \u201cmake-pretend money project\u201d was actually, finally, starting to pay off! Until later that year, when Trucoin had to pivot\u00a0and\u00a0cut costs\u2013 including directly supporting core development.\n\nJeff Garzik was the second full-time paid Bitcoin Core developer, thanks to the [support of BitPay](http:\/\/bitcoinmagazine.com\/4515\/bitpay-hires-jeff-garzik\/). \u00a0I started getting paid again in 2013, by the Bitcoin Foundation. Today the Foundation pays three people to work full-time on the core code and protocol (me, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields). And Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille are supported by [Blockstream](http:\/\/www.blockstream.com\/).\n\nSo in less than two years we\u2019ve gone from zero to three organizations directly supporting Core development\u2013 BitPay, Blockstream, and the Bitcoin Foundation. Eliminating single points of failure is one of the key concepts that makes Bitcoin such a reliable system, and I\u2019m very happy that we have multiple, independent organizations supporting core development.\n\nAccording to github, 259 different people have directly contributed to the Core code \u2014 and it has been forked on github 4,427 times. Development is less centralized than ever.\n\nCore development has more resources than ever, but there are still two\u00a0critical, long-standing, unmet needs:\n\n1. Somebody dedicated to ongoing security review of changes to the core code. We (the Foundation)\u00a0hope to announce a new hire to fill this role very soon.\n2. Somebody dedicated to deep, thorough testing of the core code. Somebody understands Bitcoin deeply who will\u00a0write test plans and then beg or bribe or hire people to run those tests. Ideally, somebody who can also write regression tests to automate testing. If you are that person, send your resume to jobs@bitcoinfoundation.org \u2014\u00a0and, if you have time, jump in and start! The Foundation can\u2019t afford to pay\u00a0you right now, but if you do a good job you\u2019ll be the first person hired when we can.\n\nWe\u2019re all working towards a shared goal\u2013 improve both the reference implementation and the process for evolving the protocol.

Development was completely centralized and controlled by him (or her, or them, or it &#8212; but I&#8217;m pretty sure Satoshi is not a robot AI).<\/p>\n<p>When Satoshi stepped away in 2011, the project was already much\u00a0less centralized, with several volunteer programmers contributing changes, reviewing each other&#8217;s code, and debating what color to <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/bikeshedding\">paint the bike sheds<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In 2012, thanks to the support of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trucoin.com\/\">Trucoin<\/a>, I became the first full-time paid developer working on Bitcoin Core. My wife was happy; my &#8220;make-pretend money project&#8221; was actually, finally, starting to pay off! Until later that year, when Trucoin had to pivot\u00a0and\u00a0cut costs&#8211; including directly supporting core development.<\/p>\n<p>Jeff Garzik was the second full-time paid Bitcoin Core developer, thanks to the <a href=\"http:\/\/bitcoinmagazine.com\/4515\/bitpay-hires-jeff-garzik\/\">support of BitPay<\/a>. \u00a0I started getting paid again in 2013, by the Bitcoin Foundation. Today the Foundation pays three people to work full-time on the core code and protocol (me, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory Fields). And Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille are supported by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blockstream.com\/\">Blockstream<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So in less than two years we&#8217;ve gone from zero to three organizations directly supporting Core development&#8211; BitPay, Blockstream, and the Bitcoin Foundation. Eliminating single points of failure is one of the key concepts that makes Bitcoin such a reliable system, and I&#8217;m very happy that we have multiple, independent organizations supporting core development.<\/p>\n<p>According to github, 259 different people have directly contributed to the Core code &#8212; and it has been forked on github 4,427 times. Development is less centralized than ever.<\/p>\n<p>Core development has more resources than ever, but there are still two\u00a0critical, long-standing, unmet needs:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Somebody dedicated to ongoing security review of changes to the core code. We (the Foundation)\u00a0hope to announce a new hire to fill this role very soon.<\/li>\n<li>Somebody dedicated to deep, thorough testing of the core code. Somebody understands Bitcoin deeply who will\u00a0write test plans and then beg or bribe or hire people to run those tests. Ideally, somebody who can also write regression tests to automate testing. If you are that person, send your resume to jobs@bitcoinfoundation.org &#8212;\u00a0and, if you have time, jump in and start! The Foundation can&#8217;t afford to pay\u00a0you right now, but if you do a good job you&#8217;ll be the first person hired when we can.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>We&#8217;re all working towards a shared goal&#8211; improve both the reference implementation and the process for evolving the protocol.

The board should hire the leadership team, support the leadership team and, if necessary, fire the leadership team.\n2. The board should review goals and financials to ensure that the leadership team is performing in-line with the Foundation\u2019s mission.\n3.

The bylaws are the basis for the organizational structure of the Foundation, and all board members must be well versed in their details and impacts on Foundation business.\n- Attend all board meetings. Board members are expected to attend all board meetings. Currently, our regular meetings occur once per month via video conference and are scheduled to accommodate a wide range of time zones of the participants. Interim meetings may also be required from time to time.\n- Occasional travel may be required. Board members may at times be required to travel on behalf of the Foundation. Pre-approved travel costs will be paid by the Foundation.\n- Perform officer roles as assigned. Board members can be assigned officer roles in addition to basic board obligations, and are responsible for all tasks related to those roles as outlined in the bylaws.\n- Act in the best interest of the Foundation and its members. As the public faces of the Foundation, board members should conduct themselves responsibly in addition to actively seeking to further the goals of the Foundation.\n\n***How do I campaign for the election?***\n\nWhile I\u2019m super excited to discuss a unique platform for campaigning, we\u2019re not quite ready to go live. \u00a0All nominees are encouraged to use their own resources for engaging the members (blogs, web sites, etc). However, we will have a sub-forum where candidates can create their own thread, if needed.\n\n***How do I get a ballot?***\n\nAll members who wish to vote must register. You will receive an email with further instructions. Be sure to\u00a0[update your email address](https:\/\/members.bitcoinfoundation.org\/)!
